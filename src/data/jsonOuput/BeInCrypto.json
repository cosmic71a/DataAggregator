    "content": "\tAvalanche’s (AVAX) price is facing significant resistance that could potentially invalidate the potential of a rally and push the altcoin back into consolidation.\n\tAVAX holders could change the outcome, but they, too, would need incentives that the crypto asset may not be able to offer.\n\tAvalanche’s price at $37 had broken out of the month-long consolidation it was in, reigniting investors’ optimism about gains. But AVAX fell back below the resistance of $39, essentially reinitiating consolidation.\n\tOne reason behind this is the lack of push from the broader market, as evidenced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, providing buy and sell signals.\n\tFor the last couple of days, the MACD has maintained a bullish crossover, but this could change soon. At the moment, the signal line is close to moving above the MACD line, and when that happens, a bearish crossover will be confirmed.\n\tThis could disrupt the potential rally.\n\tIn addition, Avalanche’s price is facing major resistance between $37 and $41. This is because, according to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, AVAX holders bought about 11.9 million AVAX worth $409.7 million in this range.\n\tTo break out of the consolidation, the altcoin would first need to make this supply profitable. This could sustain investors’ bullishness as well. They would be incentivized to participate on the network and push the price further up.\n\tRead More: How To Buy Avalanche (AVAX) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tHowever, the chances of this supply becoming profit-bearing are unlikely since the bullish cues are weak currently.\n\tAvalanche’s price, trading at $37, could gradually fall to support at $31 since the aforementioned factors suggest a bearish outcome. The resistance at $39 and support at $31 are the two limits of consolidation that AVAX has been in for more than a month.\n\tRead More: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tBut if the market observes bullish cues, Avalanche’s price would have a shot at reclaiming $39 as a support floor. Doing so would initiate a recovery for AVAX, sending it to $42.\n\tThe next major resistance is 45. If the altcoin reaches it, the bearish thesis can be considered invalidated.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Reports from DefiLlama co-founder 0xngmi indicate withdrawals exceeding $50 million. Despite this, 0xngmi contextualized the situation, stating that the withdrawals are nothing compared to Bybit’s total assets.\n\tIn response to these unsettling events, a Bybit spokesperson clarified the situation in an interview with BeInCrypto.

This report confirms the stability of its asset base, along with data from other reputable on-chain analysis platforms such as Nansen and DefiLlama.\n\tThis incident occurs against a backdrop of heightened vigilance within the crypto community. Following the high-profile collapses of several crypto firms in 2022, including FTX and Celsius, there is a pervasive atmosphere of caution and skepticism about the solvency of crypto exchanges.\n\tHistorically, such rumors have not been confined to Bybit alone.

    "content": "\tThe Uniswap Foundation announced that on-chain voting for a proposal to establish its new fee mechanism will occur by May 31.\n\tThis announcement has boosted the value of the network’s native token, UNI, by over 20%.\n\tThe Uniswap Foundation outlined a crucial step towards implementing autonomous fee collection and distribution in Uniswap V3 pools.\n\t“If passed, this proposal would transfer ownership of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory to a newly deployed instance of V3FactoryOwner. This vote will not turn on fees; that will be accomplished in a future proposal,” the Foundation explained.\n\tIn February, the Uniswap Foundation proposed a fee reward mechanism for UNI token holders to boost governance participation.

    "time": "2024-05-23",
    "author": "Daria Krasnova",
    "content": "\tDecentralized finance (DeFi) platforms continuously transform, bringing innovative financial solutions and enhancing security through distributed systems. An essential component of the dYdX Chain’s functionality is its staking mechanism: as with other Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms, it secures and stabilizes the chain whilst enabling the community to actively participate in governance and consensus processes.\n\tThis article provides a guide to staking DYDX tokens on the dYdX Chain, from understanding the basics of staking to managing and optimizing your positions.\n\tStaking in the context of blockchain technology involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network and receive rewards. In many Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms, staking contributes to the network’s security and efficiency. Users stake their tokens to gain the right to participate in managing the network, including voting on protocol changes and validating transactions. dYdX Chain leverages the Cosmos SDK Staking module which supports a PoS blockchain and enables DYDX holders to become Validators and/or delegate the stake of their DYDX to a dYdX Chain Validator. For the dYdX Chain, staking is not only a measure to secure the network but also a mechanism to reward stakers. Stakers help to decentralize the Validator set improving the decentralization of the network. In return, they earn staking rewards, which are predominantly derived from the trading fees generated by the platform.\n\tdYdX distributes 100% of protocol fees to stakers in USDC instead of the native token. As of today, the protocol has allocated $24.6 million to over 21,000 stakers. According to Mintscan, current APR for staking DYDX sits at 19,45%.\n\tThe process of staking DYDX tokens involves several key steps:\n\tStaking DYDX tokens on the dYdX Chain is key to secure the network, rewards stakers with USDC staking rewards and enables the community to participate in governance.. This guide will provide you with a clear and concise method to stake your DYDX using the Keplr wallet, which interfaces directly with the dYdX Chain, allowing for both standard and liquid staking options. Staking is also available through Ledger Live, Leap and Anchorage. Over time it’s likely there will be additional staking providers to choose from.\n\tKeplr is a non-custodial blockchain wallet accessible via a web browser extension or mobile app. It’s specially designed for the Cosmos ecosystem and is enabled by Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).\n\tStep-by-Step Procedure\n\t1. Bridge Tokens: First, make sure your DYDX tokens are on the dYdX Chain by following the bridging from Ethereum to dYdX Chain how to guide.\n\t2. Setup Keplr Wallet:\n\tStaking:\n\tFollow this How-to-Stake guide for further information.\n\tLiquid Staking Option\n\tYou can also opt for liquid staking through platforms like Stride, Quicksilver and pStake Finance, which allows you to stake DYDX and receive liquid staking tokens in return.\n\tStaking DYDX is a straightforward process: once your tokens are bridged and your Keplr wallet is set up, you’re ready to jump in. By staking, you not only help secure the network, you receive 100% of protocol fees distributed to dYdX Chain Stakers. Choose your Validator/s wisely to maximize your returns and secure your investment.\n\tRedelegating DYDX tokens allows you to shift your staked tokens from one Validator to another on the dYdX Chain without undergoing an un-bonding period. This guide will walk you through the process of re-delegation using the Keplr wallet, ensuring your tokens remain active and continue earning rewards while switching Validators.\n\t1. Access Validators List: Log into your Keplr wallet and navigate to the staking section where your current validators are listed.\n\t2. Initiate Redelegation:\n\t3. Select New Validator:\n\t4. Confirmation\n\tAfter the transaction, check your dashboard to confirm the update to your staked tokens’ allocation.\n\tRe-delegation is a valuable feature that enhances flexibility in staking strategies without sacrificing reward potential. It’s essential to consider the performance and reliability of new Validators Remember, the slashing risk of your tokens will follow the original Validator’s performance until the end of the u-nbonding period.\n\tUnstaking DYDX tokens is a process to remove your tokens from being actively staked to a Validator on the dYdX Chain. This guide provides an overview of the steps to withdraw your stake using the Keplr wallet, detailing the un-bonding period and the management of the tokens post-unstake.\n\tStep-by-Step Procedure\n\tUn-staking DYDX tokens allows you to regain control of your assets, but it requires understanding the risks and timing due to the un-bonding period. Once unstaked, you can choose to restake with a different Validator or manage your tokens as you see fit. This flexibility supports diverse strategies aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\tThe choice of Validator is crucial since a Validator’s performance and reliability affect the staking rewards. Validators with high uptime and efficiency in transaction processing are likely to generate higher rewards for their stakers.\n\tStaking on blockchain networks involves certain risks, including slashing. If a Validator acts maliciously or fails to fulfill their duties, they and their stakers may be penalized by slashing (partial loss) of the staked tokens. Therefore, choosing a reputable and reliable validator is essential.\n\tStaked DYDX tokens are locked up during the staking period, which means they are not liquid and cannot be traded or transferred. Understanding the terms related to the lock-up period, including any conditions that might affect the ability to withdraw or move staked tokens, is vital for effective staking strategy planning.\n\tExperienced stakers might engage in strategies such as staking derivatives, where they use synthetic assets to represent staked tokens, allowing them to remain liquid. Additionally, dynamic staking strategies might involve shifting stakes between validators based on performance and reward forecasts.\n\tStaking DYDX tokens secures and stabilizes the network, rewards stakers with 100% of protocol fees distributed in USDC and enables the community to participate in governing a fully decentalized market leading protocol. To date over 15%(153M) of the total DYDX token supply is locked up and securing the dYdX Chain. When selecting Validators DYOR, manage risk, and if you decide to engage in advanced staking strategies understand the risks.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tFSL, the company behind the popular move-to-earn game Stepn, is launching a new version called Stepn Go.\n\tThe upgraded app introduces various social elements to the existing Solana-based game, enhancing the user experience on iOS and Android.\n\tBuilding on the original Stepn app’s success, which has rewarded players with crypto tokens for physical activity since 2021, Stepn Go aims to advance the move-to-earn concept further. The original app boasts over 5.6 million users and partnerships with brands like Adidas and Asics.\n\tOne standout feature is the “Haus System.” This allows NFT owners to lend their digital sneakers to others and share the crypto rewards, making it easier for new users to join the platform without purchasing NFTs upfront.\n\tThe app includes an interactive map, enabling players to see other users and leave messages. Additionally, a player-vs-player (PvP) mode allows users to compete and earn FSL’s ecosystem token, GMT.\n\tRead more: What Is STEPN (GMT)?\n\tFSL co-founder Yawn Rong emphasized the community’s role in these developments.\n\t“The community has been requesting social features since the early days of Stepn. We’re excited to reveal these new features, which will propel Stepn Go into mainstream adoption,” said Rong.\n\tStepn Go offers a new token, the Go Gaming Token (GGT), which users can earn through physical activities. This token adds another incentive for users to stay active and engaged with the app. The original Stepn app will continue to operate, rewarding users with cryptocurrency for walking, jogging, or running while wearing NFT sneakers.\n\tRead more: Top 14 Play-To-Earn NFT Games\n\tIn response to user feedback, Stepn Go includes several community-suggested enhancements. The app’s “Interactive Map” enhances user interaction by allowing connections between players, including adding friends and exchanging messages during activities.\n\tThe alpha version of Stepn Go will debut in Q3 2024. During this launch, there will be a Sneaker NFT Alpha Prize Draw, with FSL giving out 5,000 digital sneakers to community members who pledge their GMT tokens.\n\tThe roadmap includes several exciting features that will roll out gradually. Users can expect customizable avatars and outfits, an energy system to maintain economic sustainability, and the ability to earn GGT by engaging in physical activities. Stepn Go’s innovative features and community-focused approach are set to revolutionize the move-to-earn sector, making it more interactive and rewarding.\n\tGiven the transforming gaming sector, Stepn seems to have timed the release of the update just right. Prominent industry participants believe that game projects need to significantly revise strategies to stay on track.\n\t“The Play-to-Earn sector faced significant challenges during the bear market, primarily because the games attracted players interested solely in making money. It’s encouraging to see games like ‘Stepn Go’ recognizing that user retention and engagement are crucial. To succeed, games need to appeal to two distinct groups: traditional gamers who play for fun and crypto gamers who play to earn. These experiences can be vastly different, as the token game operates as a meta-game driven by the primary game’s activity. The Haus system is a good example of this thesis, as it connects owners to players, enhancing engagement and retention,” Alex Casassovici, CEO and Founder of Azarus, told BeInCrypto.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

A break below it could signal weakening bullish momentum and lead to further downward pressure.\n\t$0.4584 (61.8% Fibonacci Level): Holding above this level is critical for maintaining the bullish outlook. A dip below this point could indicate a potential trend reversal.\n\t$0.4870 (61.8% Fibonacci Level): This level on the daily chart is crucial. Staying above it supports the continuation of the bullish trend. A break below it could invalidate the current upward momentum.\n\t$0.4501 (78.6% Fibonacci Level): Often a strong support zone, a break below this level would suggest a significant shift in market sentiment towards a bearish trend.\n\tIf ADA breaks into the daily Ichimoku cloud, targeting the range of $0.5388 to $0.5709, it could propel the price to higher levels in the mid-term.\n\tRead More: How To Buy Cardano (ADA) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tThe Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart provides a major resistance around the $0.4645 level.

BlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise joined the ranks of Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, who had already made similar amendments.\n\tThis move comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry and signals a strategic shift to comply with potential SEC concerns.\n\tIn a May 22 filing from the Nasdaq Stock Market, asset management firm BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF 19b-4 application to exclude staking provisions. Grayscale and Bitwise also filed similar amendments with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\t“Neither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ether or generate income or other earnings,” the amended part reads in all the three filings.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tCommenting on the asset managers’ amendment spree, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said these actions clarified the SEC’s stance on staking for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\t“Looks like you got a final answer as to whether SEC will allow staking: No. As this is the first amendment of any document to roll in post-SEC 180 and their comments to issuers,” Balchunas said.\n\tThe crypto community sees the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs as a bullish sentiment for the broader market. However, approving these ETFs without accommodating staking could disadvantage investors interested in earning additional yield from staking rewards.\n\tThose who purchase, hold, and stake ETH have the opportunity to receive staking rewards, which can result in extra yield. Hence, by excluding the staking aspect, spot Ethereum ETFs will be unable to provide additional benefits for investors.\n\tMeanwhile, several industry experts believe political considerations could influence the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, especially with the upcoming US presidential election in November. Citing former US president Donald Trump’s move to support the crypto industry, some see this sudden change as “political.”\n\t“I think this decision from above, possibly above the SEC’s head, like Biden, the Biden admin that decided it’s not worth fighting this. We might even lose in court if we try to do this and somebody sues us and we’re losing the votes, people are going to Trump solely because of the stance here, and it’s just not worth it,” Seyffart explained.\n\tIndeed, Presidents Biden and Trump have taken contrasting stances toward the crypto industry.

In a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, they emphasized that by green-lighting a BTC-based instrument, the regulator set a precedent that should extend to Ethereum.\n\tThe SEC faces a deadline to decide on the VanEck Ethereum ETF, with other applications from BlackRock and Fidelity pending. Lawmakers emphasized the importance of maintaining investor protection while embracing modern financial markets. They argued that the same legal considerations for Bitcoin should apply to Ethereum, ensuring a consistent regulatory framework.\n\t“Approving Bitcoin ETPs demonstrates the Commission’s fidelity to its mission to protect investors as well as the need to embrace the modern financial market.

    "content": "\tUniswap Labs, the leading developer of the decentralized trading platform on Ethereum, asserted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) potential enforcement action against it lacks merit.\n\tAccording to the New York-based startup, crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. Instead, they are files similar to PDFs.\n\tOn Tuesday, Uniswap Labs contested the allegations that it operates an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows a Wells notice served by the SEC’s Enforcement Division last month, indicating plans to recommend legal action against the company.\n\tMarvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, spoke at a press conference, emphasizing the SEC’s flawed assumption that all tokens are securities. Uniswap Labs also argues that now, the SEC risks an adverse decision that could limit its authority over crypto tokens.\n\t“Tokens are, in fact, simply a file format. They are a file format for value and they are not inherently securities. The SEC has to essentially unilaterally change the definitions of exchange, broker and investment contract in order to try to capture what we do.” Ammori said.\n\tRead more: How To Buy Uniswap (UNI) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tIn a 40-page response, the company expressed its readiness to litigate if necessary, asserting confidence in its legal standing.\n\tSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently argued that decentralized exchanges fall within the SEC’s regulatory scope. He has stated that many digital assets are unregistered securities subject to SEC rules.\n\tHowever, Uniswap Labs maintains that UNI tokens, its governance tokens, do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This legal standard from a Supreme Court ruling defines investment contracts.\n\t“Uniswap Labs’ stance has the potential to be a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Challenging existing paradigms and prompting a more nuanced understanding of digital assets could pave the way for a future that fosters innovation while protecting consumers,” Yale ReiSoleil, CEO of crypto investment platform Untrading told BeInCrypto.\n\tIn light of these developments, Uniswap’s UNI token saw a 4% increase in value over the past 24 hours, trading at $9.63.\n\tThe broader crypto market closely watches the SEC’s actions, especially as the US election approaches and crypto becomes a significant political issue. Some believe that the SEC’s stance on crypto may be shifting. Also there are expectations that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23.\n\tThis anticipated approval is believed to result from political pressure. Crypto enthusiasts speculate that the Biden administration and former President Donald Trump might have realized the crypto community’s growing influence.\n\tNot to mention, Trump’s campaign recently allowed donations via crypto, signaling a more crypto-friendly approach.\n\tRead more: What Does It Mean To Receive a Wells Notice From the SEC?\n\t“Biden and Trump now trying to outdo each other pandering to the crypto bros.

    "content": "\tThe cryptocurrency market is abuzz with anticipation over the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\tDaniel Yan, co-founder of Matrixport, believes Solana (SOL) could be next in line.\n\tAs the SEC’s decision on a spot Ethereum ETF looms, speculation is rife about which cryptocurrency might be next. Daniel Yan believes Solana is a prime candidate, potentially benefiting from Ethereum’s anticipated success: he draws parallels to the Bitcoin ETF approval, which boosted Ethereum’s value and market interest.\n\tIndeed, the launch of the spot BTC ETF in the US led to a 12% increase in the ETH/BTC pair within a week. Matrixport co-founder suggests Solana could experience similar momentum.\n\tСrypto community members are also actively speculating that the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF will inevitably lead to applications for ETFs on other altcoins. Popular crypto analyst Ted also hinted at the possibility of spot the ETF filings shortly.\n\t“The market is certainly not priced for this… if it’s approved, get ready for all kinds of spot altcoin filings. cough, cough SOL,” he remarked.\n\tOn the other hand, some experts believe that filing for a spot ETF for Solana might be challenging because SOL futures ETF is not yet listed. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which had actively trading futures ETFs at the time of their spot ETF approvals, Solana lacks this critical step, potentially hindering its immediate consideration for a spot ETF.\n\t“It is natural for the crypto sphere to be excited about the potential of Solana ETF to be listed, but this would be a major stretch. There are no futures listed on Solana. If anything, the ones surprisingly ahead of Solana, by virtue of these being listed on CFTC-regulated Coinbase Derivatives, are BCH, LTC, and yes Doge ( not a surprise, fair launch POW chains),” Dimitrios Kavvathas, Founder of Ithaca told BeInCrypto.\n\tWhile no Solana ETFs are currently approved in the US, alternatives like the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) and products such as VanEck’s Solana ETN and 21Shares’ Solana ETP offer exposure to SOL prices, albeit through derivatives. These products provide investors with indirect ways to trade SOL, reflecting its price movements.\n\tOver the past week, SOL has surged by more than 23%, indicating heightened interest and speculation. This impressive rise reflects growing investor confidence and anticipation surrounding Solana’s potential.\n\tRead more: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tWith the right regulatory environment, it could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum in achieving ETF approval, marking a turning point in its development.

Furthermore, Kelly suggested that if the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs, it would provide clearer regulations for Ethereum and the broader market. This potentially leads to the approval of more spot crypto ETFs, including Solana.\n\tRead more: Crypto ETN vs. Crypto ETF: What Is the Difference?\n\tETF analyst James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence offered insights in response to Kelly’s speculation. Seyffart emphasized the regulatory hurdles Solana faces, particularly due to its current classification as a security by the SEC.\n\t“Based on current precedent/needs — Will happen within a few years of getting a CFTC regulated futures market. But Congress & Market structure bills like FIT21 could make it happen quicker. I think a SOL ETF would see most demand vs other digital assets (aside from BTC & ETH). But SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security’. Which could very easily make this a very rocky road,” Seyffart noted.\n\tDespite the challenges, Seyffart acknowledged the demand for Solana ETFs. However, he suggested that Litecoin (LTC) might see ETF approval first, albeit with less market interest. Crypto journalist Laura Shin added that while Litecoin might have “little regulatory baggage,” Solana makes sense from a usage and fundamentals perspective.\n\tThe crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s official decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, which could set the stage for future approvals. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that an announcement might come around 16:00 today. His prediction was based on the timing of the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tAs the market watches closely, discussions around Solana and other potential spot ETFs continue to evolve, highlighting the complexities and opportunities within the crypto regulatory environment.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

The evidence of the same can be seen in the Open Interest in the Futures market.\n\tOpen interest (OI) refers to the total number of active derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled.

    "time": "2024-05-22",
    "author": "Lynn Wang",
    "content": "\tUS Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to regulate digital asset markets. He believes the bill would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors by reclassifying crypto assets and reducing regulatory oversight.\n\tAt the same time, The House is set to vote on the bill, which faces notable opposition and an uncertain future in the Senate.\n\tIn a Wednesday report, Gary Gensler expressed his strong opposition to the FIT21 Act. The bill, introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson and backed by several key Republicans, aims to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets. It seeks to balance innovation with strong consumer protections and clarifies the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) roles in regulating cryptocurrency.\n\tGensler argues that the bill undermines classifying crypto assets as investment contracts. This change would remove these assets from the SEC’s oversight, making it harder to protect investors.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tHe noted that FIT21 might enable crypto firms to self-certify their products as “decentralized” digital commodities, thus avoiding SEC scrutiny. Gensler warned that the SEC’s limited resources would hinder its ability to challenge these certifications, leaving much of the crypto market unregulated.\n\tGensler also criticized the bill’s definition of a digital commodity. He said that it ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of the assets. Furthermore, he warned that FIT21 could harm the broader US capital markets by allowing companies to evade SEC regulation through decentralized networks.\n\t“The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws. By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled—but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny—that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” Gensler explained.\n\tStuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), shared his thoughts on Gensler’s stance and current approach to crypto regulation.\n\t“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability,” Alderoty said.\n\tThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday. However, its passage through the Senate remains to be determined. If enacted, the bill would alter the Howey test and significantly reduce the SEC’s oversight of crypto assets. Introduced in 1946, the Howey Test determines if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and, thus, a security.\n\tAt least eight House Democrats support the FIT21 Act and may gain more backers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering supporting the bill. Despite no longer being in Democratic leadership, Pelosi’s opinions still influence many House Democrats.\n\tIf Pelosi supports the bill, she would go against Ranking Members Democrats Maxine Waters and David Scott, who both oppose it. They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. They see this deregulation severely undermining US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.\n\tRead more: How Does Regulation Impact Crypto Marketing? A Complete Guide\n\tBeInCrypto previously reported that Waters and Scott urged their colleagues to vote against the bill. However, House Democrats leaders have stated they will not whip against the FIT21 bill.

    "author": "Lynn Wang",
    "content": "\tOn May 23, the US House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, introduced in 2023 by Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The bill aims to amend the Federal Reserve Act to prevent central bank digital currency (CBDC) from being used for monetary policy or direct consumer services.\n\tThis legislation seeks to ensure that digital currency development upholds American principles of privacy and individual autonomy.\n\tThe House passed the bill by 216-192 on Thursday afternoon. By then, it had 165 Republican cosponsors.\n\tThe debate on the Republican-supported bill saw sparse attendance. Republican proponents emphasized the risk of CBDC misuse, while Democrats focused on innovation, the dollar’s global standing, and flaws in the bill’s drafting.\n\tDuring the delivery, Chairman Patrick McHenry highlighted instances where governments, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), have used CBDCs to monitor citizens’ spending behaviors. This surveillance implements a social credit system that either rewards or penalizes individuals based on their actions. McHenry asserted that this form of financial surveillance is unacceptable in the US.\n\t“Concerningly, it appears the current Administration does not agree. In 2022, the White House issued an Executive Order pushing for CBDC research and development. The corresponding report responding to that Executive Order did nothing to ease those concerns. This is why the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act is necessary. The bill requires authorizing legislation from Congress for the issuance of any CBDC—ensuring that it must reflect American values. If not open, permissionless, and private, a CBDC is no more than a CCP-style surveillance tool waiting to be weaponized,” Chairman McHenry stated.\n\tRead more: Crypto vs. Banking: Which Is a Smarter Choice?\n\tAfter the bill’s passage, Whip Emmer reaffirmed his commitment to improving the digital economy environment in the US.\n\t“My legislation ensures that the United States’ digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people so that any development of digital money reflects our values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. This is what the future global digital economy needs. We are proud to have led this effort and thank my colleagues for their support,” he affirmed.\n\tYet, the bill does not prohibit the issuance of “dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private, and fully preserves the privacy protections of United States coins and physical currency,” which many believe refers to stablecoins. Representative French Hill’s statement further supported this part.\n\t“For example, private sector payment stablecoins are a terrific innovation that will become a ubiquitous way for people to transact and expand and enhance the dollar dominance of our currency around the world,” he said.\n\tThe crypto community reacted positively, with some speculating that Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin perfectly fits the description. JackTheRippler, a prominent figure in Ripple’s XRP community, expressed his excitement on X (Twitter).\n\t“The US Government can’t make a CBDC but they can adopt a stablecoin on a public existing network. Guess who will launch a high-quality stablecoin on the XRP Ledger this year? Ripple!” JackTheRippler wrote.\n\tHowever, Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin might be in jeopardy due to a recent redacted remedies reply brief from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month. The SEC highlights Ripple’s plan to launch a new crypto asset, which many believe refers to the company’s stablecoin—the SEC attached the press release of Ripple’s stablecoin for reference.\n\tThis passage marks the third instance of the US House passing cryptocurrency-related legislation. BeInCrypto recently reported that the House passed two other crypto bills this month: H.J. Res. 109 and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).\n\tRead more: What Is a Stablecoin? A Beginner’s Guide\n\tH.J. Res 109 aims to overturn the SEC’s contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). Meanwhile, FIT21 seeks to define the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regulating cryptocurrencies. FIT21 also sets guidelines for various aspects of the crypto market, including token issuance, trading, and custody.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tThe National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV) confirmed the country is considering cooperating with El Salvador on Bitcoin adoption. This follows an important meeting between Argentinian and Salvadoran regulators last week.\n\tOfficials from Argentina’s CNV met with Juan Carlos Reyes, head of El Salvador’s National Digital Assets Commission (CNAD), to discuss El Salvador’s Bitcoin regulation strategies.\n\tHigh-ranking CNV officials, including President Roberto Silva and Vice President Patricia Boedo, visited El Salvador. The President highlighted Argentina’s proactive stance in learning and praised El Salvador’s progress in forming cooperation agreements.\n\t“El Salvador has emerged as a leading country in the use of Bitcoin and the broader world of crypto assets. We want to strengthen ties with El Salvador. We will explore signing collaboration agreements with their government,” Silva stated.\n\tThe CNV’s efforts could relieve Argentina’s Bitcoin community. Despite President Javier Milei’s pro-Bitcoin stance, Buenos Aires faces pressure from the IMF to regulate crypto exchanges.\n\tThe country faces severe economic challenges, including high inflation and currency depreciation, have spurred Bitcoin trading. Crypto adoption has increased since 2017, with many using it for everyday transactions. The country has also seen a rise in crypto startups, offering innovative solutions to economic challenges.\n\tRead more: Crypto Adoption in Argentina: Everything To Know\n\tStrict currency controls have led to a surge in stablecoin use. These digital assets provide a hedge against currency restrictions. A report by Bitso indicated that 60% of crypto trading volume in Argentina comes from stablecoins like USDT or USDC.\n\tEl Salvador, under President Nayib Bukele, became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Bukele’s initiative has significantly boosted the country’s economy. BTC adoption has attracted global tourists to El Salvador’s popular destinations. Additionally, the country buys the asset daily and mines it using energy from volcano-powered operations.\n\tThe potential cooperation between Argentina and El Salvador could signal a shift in Argentina’s approach to crypto. With significant crypto adoption among its population, this move might pave the way for a more regulated and secure environment.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "time": "2024-05-27",
    "author": "Bary Rahma",
    "content": "\tTokenization has emerged as a groundbreaking way to revolutionize careers. By bringing professional reputations on-chain, individuals can gain greater visibility and access to opportunities.\n\tThere are numerous benefits of tokenizing one’s professional career to transform how work and talent are viewed.\n\tTokenization offers a unique financial advantage. Consider the example of Alex Masmej, who launched his $ALEX token to fund his move to San Francisco. This initiative, akin to a “career Kickstarter,” provided Masmej with the necessary resources while offering perks to his token holders.\n\tTokenizing a career allows individuals to raise funds for their professional endeavors, from starting a business to acquiring new skills, without relying on traditional financial institutions.\n\tAnother example of tokenization comes from popular YouTuber Davinci Jeremie. He developed the DJ15 token to raise funds for the DavinciJ15 YouTube channel and enhance the quality and content presented to its subscribers. The token aims to provide greater flexibility in developing content for the crypto community across various platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, and Twitch, where DavinciJ15’s content can be found.\n\t“One important thing this token is not a security. This token is just this social token, which means that you’re only going to be supporting my YouTube channel and other channels where I broadcast the streams. The money will be going 100% into that. Any money raised will be 100% going into actually improving the quality of the channel,” Jeremie explained.\n\tThese personal tokens also create a deeper emotional connection between creators and their supporters. For instance, distributing limited edition “thank you” NFTs to mentors can be a meaningful gesture. This emotional bond fosters loyalty and encourages a supportive community around the individual’s professional journey.\n\tRead more: What is Tokenization on Blockchain?\n\tThe rise of the creator economy has seen professionals form token-gated communities where fans and supporters can interact more closely. Platforms like Friend.Tech exemplify this trend, providing exclusive access and fostering a sense of belonging among token holders. Such communities enhance networking opportunities and provide valuable support systems for career growth.\n\tTokenization extends beyond financial and social aspects, offering significant benefits in knowledge sharing. Professionals can monetize their knowledge by tokenizing their expertise and contributing to a decentralized learning ecosystem.\n\tPedro Oliveira, CEO of Talent Protocol, told BeInCrypto about the importance of making reputation data more visible and accessible. He believes that Web3 can lead to fairer and more efficient distribution of opportunities. Tokenizing one’s career involves showcasing skills and achievements transparently, enabling a fairer evaluation by potential employers or collaborators.\n\t“Tokenization can equalize opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds, moving away from traditional success biases. Traditional career success metrics often create an unequal opportunity landscape. For instance, a person born in New York is statistically more likely to have a successful career than someone from a remote village. Tokenization brings reputation on-chain, enhancing visibility for global talent and maximizing the labor market’s collective potential,” Oliveira said.\n\tThe future of work, as envisioned by Oliveira, is one of diverse engagement free from organizational “middlemen.” Tokenization facilitates direct collaboration and information exchange without centralized governance, breaking down traditional professional hierarchies. This shift significantly enhances labor market efficiency, allowing talent to thrive in a more equitable environment.\n\tRead more: Web3 vs. Traditional Tech Careers: Which Is Right for You?\n\tSeveral compelling examples highlight the potential of career tokenization. Athletes, for instance, increasingly use tokenization to share revenues from future awards. Artists and influencers create on-chain engagements with their fans, offering exclusive content to token holders. These success stories demonstrate the versatility and broad appeal of tokenization across various sectors.\n\tBy tokenizing skills, individuals set transparent, on-chain rules from the outset, fostering a governance model that benefits all involved parties. Rather than a zero-sum game, tokenization enables the development of collaborative, multiplayer career paths.\n\t“These cases and trends indicate a growing recognition of tokenization as a valuable tool for career development across various sectors. The versatility of tokenization, from funding and community building to knowledge sharing, points to a broader shift in how personal and professional growth is approached in the digital age,” Oliveira concluded.\n\tEmbracing this innovative approach can lead to a more equitable and efficient labor market, benefiting individuals and the broader economy. Therefore, individuals can gain financial support by leveraging blockchain technology to build strong communities, share knowledge, and enhance their reputations.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tFollowing the Trust Project guidelines, this feature article presents opinions and perspectives from industry experts or individuals.

    "time": "2024-05-22",
    "author": "Shota Oba",
    "content": "\tWith the House of Representatives poised to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) today, the White House’s position on the bill has become prominent. The administration has opposed the bill, raising concerns but stopping short of issuing a veto threat.\n\tThe Biden administration is willing to collaborate with Congress to develop a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for crypto assets.\n\tIn its statement on Wednesday, the administration outlined several critical issues with FIT21. The primary concern was the bill’s perceived need for more sufficient protections for consumers and investors.\n\t“The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4763, which would affect the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States,” the statement read.\n\tRead more: How Does Regulation Impact Crypto Marketing? A Complete Guide\n\tThe White House’s opposition to FIT21 is significant as the House readies for the vote. If it becomes law, FIT21 would significantly bolster the regulatory oversight of crypto spot markets and digital commodities, such as bitcoin. It also introduces a mechanism for secondary market trading of digital commodities initially offered as part of investment contracts.\n\tDespite opposition to FIT21, the White House strongly desires to work with Congress. The statement further underlined the administration’s intent to leverage existing authorities to foster an environment conducive to innovation while safeguarding consumers and investors. Senator Cynthia Lummis commented on the bill’s bipartisan support.\n\t“There’s a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress in favor of crypto. The future is very bright,” she stated.\n\tFIT21 has sparked controversy. Representative Maxine Waters criticized the bill during a House Rules Committee meeting. Waters argued that FIT21 would stretch the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) resources, weakening its enforcement capabilities. She also highlighted that with its more extensive staff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be better suited to oversee the industry.\n\tRead more: 7 Best Crypto Exchanges in the USA for Bitcoin (BTC) Trading\n\tSEC Chair Gary Gensler has also voiced his opposition to FIT21. Gensler warned that the bill would create new regulatory gaps by disregarding the Howey Test, an essential legal standard for determining whether an asset qualifies as a security.\n\tFIT21 faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Many top lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Senate have shown little interest in the bill. Investment bank TD Cowen recently suggested that FIT21 cannot become law in this Congress.\n\tPolitical dynamics may also impact the bill’s fate. There have been rumblings that the Biden administration is paying more attention to crypto, given its potential influence on voters in the upcoming presidential election. Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made pro-crypto moves, including accepting campaign donations in crypto.\n\tMeanwhile, some prominent figures in the crypto industry are confident that the vote outcome will not really affect the current regulatory situation in the US.\n\t“The pursuit by US regulators of companies and services within the ecosystem has become significantly severe, ranging from hefty fines to exchanges for non-compliance to multiple arrests of developers or users who seek to enhance privacy on certain networks. I believe that for the rest of the world, this represents an advantage, as those nations that anticipate the dynamism of the ecosystem will receive much more attention from projects that will not hesitate to discard or move out of the US to avoid headaches,” Hernán González, Member of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina, told BeInCrypto.\n\tThe debate over FIT21 highlights the complexities of regulating the crypto market. As the House prepares to vote, the administration’s stance reflects the importance of developing a regulatory framework that ensures market stability while encouraging technological advancements in the crypto industry.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tAs the final decision on VanEck’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approaches, the financial and crypto communities are abuzz.\n\tThe crypto community speculates if the potential approval has been priced into Ethereum’s (ETH) market value or if it could lead to significant market changes.\n\tEric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, anticipates an announcement from the SEC around 16:00 ET today. Based on previous decisions, like the one for the spot Bitcoin ETF approved at 15:45 ET, we might expect a similar schedule.\n\tMarkus Thielen of 10X Research suggests that SEC Chair Gary Gensler could precede the decision with a cautionary tweet about investment risks. This is similar to his approach before the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tThis tweet, expected around 9 AM ET, could indicate whether an approval is likely. Previously, the SEC issued warnings ahead of significant crypto-related decisions, including the Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\tMany in the crypto sector wonder if this approval could lead to a “sell the news” scenario. However, Crypto Nova, a well-known crypto analyst, argues that the market has yet to adjust to such an event. Crypto Nova suggests investors examine the data.\n\t“Since the last bull run of 2021, Ethereum (and alts in general) have been down only against Bitcoin. The market had eyes on Bitcoin only due to the spot ETF approval and halving. None of it has shifted to Ethereum yet,” Crypto Nova said.\n\tThis indicates that an altseason, historically accompanied by significant gains for Ethereum, hasn’t started yet. “None of the potential approval effects are priced in,” claims Crypto Nova, noting the massive upside potential for Ethereum. She predicted a price target of $10,000 for Ethereum this year.\n\tConversely, investors should remember the post-approval market reaction for the Bitcoin spot ETF, where Bitcoin’s price fell over 20% to the $38,000 level. This serves as a cautionary tale that the approval could still result in a sell-off.\n\tRead more: 11 Cryptos To Add To Your Portfolio Before Altcoin Season\n\tNonetheless, the long-term perspective remains bullish.

    "content": "\tIn an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, digital strategist Jacky Rivero shared invaluable insights into effective crypto marketing.\n\tHer expertise sheds light on the nuances of navigating the industry, emphasizing storytelling, transparency, and community engagement as core strategies.\n\tJacky Rivero emphasized the importance of storytelling in the crowded crypto market.\n\t“Every day, more brands within and outside the niche are leaning into storytelling because it’s crucial for getting closer to their audience,” she explains.\n\tUnlike traditional pitches focusing solely on problem-solving, effective storytelling highlights the brand’s understanding of users’ issues. This approach builds trust by making the audience feel understood and valued.\n\tRivero noted that the crypto space is saturated with content, making it imperative for brands to stand out.\n\t“People are overwhelmed! The challenge is to stand out amid all that noise. That’s why it’s essential to tell stories that show how you understand the problem, not just how you solve it,” she emphasized.\n\tBy being relatable and demonstrating a deep understanding of the audience’s pain points, brands can foster a sense of connection and loyalty.\n\tTransparency is another cornerstone of Rivero’s marketing philosophy. She stressed that crypto projects must operate with a “don’t trust, verify” mindset, providing users with tools to verify the project’s security and operational status.\n\t“Features like landing pages to check protocol or exchange statuses, proof of reserves, and regular communication about audits are vital,” she said.\n\tUsers in the crypto market are acutely aware of market volatility and regulatory changes. Rivero advised that there is no need to hide these realities.\n\tRead more: 14 Best Crypto Marketing Agencies for 2024\n\tInstead, brands should maintain open communication channels to reassure users. This transparency builds trust and ensures user loyalty.\n\tCommunity engagement is crucial for long-term success in crypto marketing. Rivero highlighted the importance of creating interactive spaces and activities for users.\n\t“The community aspect is crucial — creating engaging spaces and activities for users to interact with their peers is as important as educating them,” she explained.\n\tGamified educational experiences, for instance, can keep users engaged while they learn about the project. Additionally, Rivero also highlighted the effectiveness of memes in crypto marketing.\n\t“Have you heard that ‘Memes are the DNA of the soul’? I can’t stress enough the importance of being relatable, and memes are the best way to connect, educate, and entertain,” she noted.\n\tMemes, if done correctly, can spread effortlessly and serve as a key performance indicator.\n\tRivero pointed out the unique challenges of advertising in the crypto industry, where stringent legal requirements limit many companies’ ability to run ads. For those who can, the task becomes one of creativity and brevity.\n\t“The challenge is fun — figuring out how to say more with less,” she noted.\n\tInfluencer partnerships are another critical element of a successful crypto marketing strategy. Rivero advised projects to choose creators who have tried and reviewed their products honestly.\n\t“Knowing who your target users are is critical. Are they holders? Newbies? Liquidity providers? Approach influencer partnerships knowing that your offer will reach the right crowd,” she told BeInCrypto.\n\tRead more: How to Create a Marketing Plan for Your Cryptocurrency Startup\n\tFinally, Rivero stressed the importance of balancing short-term engagement metrics with long-term growth strategies. Prioritizing organic content, especially memes, alongside SEO, can capture immediate attention and build lasting visibility.\n\t“Plan your marketing for immediate impact on social media and long-term visibility through search engine optimization,” she concluded.\n\tRivero’s insights offer a comprehensive guide for crypto projects aiming to thrive in a competitive market.

    "content": "\tThe price of Chainlink (LINK) is eying bullish momentum following its recent move.\n\tFollowing our insights in the latest BeInCrypto LINK analysis, the LINK price has confirmed the bullish outlook we’ve been anticipating.\n\tChainlink (LINK) has recently moved above the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud on a daily timeframe, which is currently around $17.41. This breakout is a bullish signal, suggesting that LINK could see further upward momentum if it maintains this level.\n\tThe 100-day EMA (blue line) is currently at $16.02, providing a strong support level. LINK has successfully tested this EMA and is trading above it, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. The price remaining above this EMA indicates sustained buying pressure.\n\tThe immediate resistance level to watch is the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud at $17.41. A break and close above this level would confirm further bullish momentum.\n\tThe support levels to watch are $16.02 (the 100-day EMA) and $14.6 (the lower boundary of the daily Ichimoku cloud). These levels are crucial for maintaining the current bullish outlook.\n\tOn the 4-hour timeframe, LINK is trading above the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bullish trend. The green cloud indicates an upward trajectory, offering support below the current price (with the Tenkan line in red).\n\tThe 100-period EMA (blue line) is at $16.050, acting as a dynamic support level. LINK has consistently traded above this EMA, reinforcing the bullish outlook.\n\tThe historical in/out of the money chart indicates the proportion of addresses that are currently in profit (green), at break-even (white), and at a loss (red) based on the current price of Chainlink.\n\tThe chart shows a significant proportion (70%) of addresses are currently in the money (green), suggesting a strong holding sentiment among investors. This is bullish as it indicates that most holders are in profit, reducing the selling pressure.\n\tHistorically, periods with a high percentage of in-the-money addresses have coincided with bullish trends in LINK’s price.\n\tMaintain Current Positions: Given the strong bullish signals from the Ichimoku Cloud breakout and support from the 100-day EMA, it is recommended to maintain current long positions. LINK’s price staying above these critical levels indicates sustained buying pressure and positive momentum.\n\tWatch Key Resistance Levels: The immediate resistance level to monitor is $17.41. A successful break and close above this level would likely lead to further upward momentum towards the next target of $18.70. Set alerts to notify of significant price movements above this resistance.\n\tMonitor Support Levels: Key support levels to watch are at $16.021 (100-day EMA) and $15.378 (lower boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud). Maintaining these support levels is crucial for sustaining the bullish trend. Consider these levels as potential entry points for adding to positions if the price retraces.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "author": "Lynn Wang",
    "content": "\tVanEck, a prominent asset management company, has updated its S-1 filing concurrently with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) announcement regarding its initial approval for multiple spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\tThis development represents a significant milestone towards the introduction of these ETFs.\n\tIn the updated S-1 filing, VanEck clarified that none of its affiliated parties, including the Trust, the Sponsor, the ETH Custodian, or any associated individuals, would participate in “Staking Activities.” The filing specifies that these entities will not, in any direct or indirect manner, be involved in actions that use any portion of the Trust’s ETH to generate staking rewards.\n\t“The Trust will not employ its ETH in Staking Activities and accordingly will not earn any form of staking rewards or income of any kind from Staking Activities. Foregoing potential returns from Staking Activities could cause an investment in Shares of the Trust to deviate from that which would have been obtained by purchasing and holding ETH directly by virtue of giving up staking as a source of return when an investor holds Shares of the Trust,” the updated filing reads.\n\tAlongside this update, VanEck launched an engaging advertisement less than an hour after the SEC’s announcement. This 37-second video emphasizes Ethereum’s potential and questions its role in fostering a less centralized, open-source economy.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tIt speculates on a future characterized by “peer-to-peer marketplaces and payments without middlemen fees,” inviting viewers to contemplate Ethereum’s possibilities. The video concludes with a call to action, “Enter the Ether. Let your mind roam free.” The advertisement resonated well with the crypto community, amassing nearly 440,000 views within 12 hours of its release.\n\tA few days before the SEC’s preliminary approval, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) featured VanEck’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF with the ticker ETHV and, later, BlackRock’s under the ticker ETHA. Despite these developments, the official launch of these ETFs remains uncertain.\n\tBeInCrypto reported that on May 23, the SEC approved the 19-4b filings for several potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers. These include VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise. However, to officially launch these ETFs, issuers must also secure approval for their S-1 forms.\n\tIndustry experts speculate on the timeline for S-1 approvals and the subsequent launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, suggested that the SEC might “slow play S-1s.” Additionally, James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted it “could be weeks or more” to finalize the S-1 approvals and the ETFs can launch.\n\tRead more: How to Invest in Ethereum ETFs?\n\tFurthermore, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported discussions between SEC staff and issuers regarding S-1 forms have begun, with a consensus that there is still “work to do” before approving these forms.

    "content": "\tRecent significant Ethereum (ETH) transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges have caught the market’s attention. This move has raised speculation about potential profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or market speculation.\n\tThese developments coincide with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nearing a decision on the Vaneck Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has heightened expectations within the industry.\n\tJeffrey Wilke, one of the founders of Ethereum, has transferred 10,000 ETH, worth around $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. While the motive behind such a significant transfer is unclear, a few hypotheses can be derived from it.\n\tWhether Wilke aims to book profits, rebalance his portfolio, or speculate on the market, he appears not the only one. Looking at Ethereum’s balance on exchanges reveals a spike in the tokens available to sell.\n\tOver the last two weeks, more than 242,000 ETH have moved to cryptocurrency exchange wallets. This indicates increased trading activity on exchanges that can contribute to price volatility.\n\tThe timing of these transfers is notable, as it aligns with today’s SEC final ruling regarding the Vaneck Ethereum ETF. Interestingly, on May 20, the SEC requested Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to refine their applications for listing spot Ethereum ETFs, hinting at a potential approval of these filings.\n\tIn response to this regulatory development, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, remarked that the likelihood of approval has substantially increased, shifting from only 25% to a considerable 75%.\n\t“Hearing chatter this afternoon that the SEC could be doing a 180 on this increasingly political issue, so now everyone is scrambling. But again, we cap it at 75% until we see more, e.g., filing updates,” Balchunas wrote.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tSimilarly, Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform that allows users to place bets on world events, shows a significant increase in approval odds, which have risen from 10% to 70% over the past 72 hours.\n\tAlthough industry leaders like Anthony Pompliano see the Ethereum ETF approval as an “approval of the entire industry” and as “the last dam to be broken,” traders must be cautious. The increasing ETH deposits to cryptocurrency exchange wallets hint at the possibility of a sell-off or a spike in profit-taking.\n\tMeanwhile, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator presents a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart.\n\tThe current green nine candlestick on the daily chart suggests that a spike in selling pressure could see Ethereum retrace for one to four daily candlesticks or even start a new downward countdown phase before the uptrend resumes.\n\tDespite the bearish signals seen from an on-chain and technical perspective, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator suggests that Ethereum is above significant areas of support that could hold in the event of a correction.\n\tBased on the IOMAP, over 1.81 million addresses bought around 1.66 million ETH between $3,820 and $3,700. This demand zone could keep Ethereum’s price at bay amid increasing selling pressure. But if it fails to hold, the next key area of support is between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses purchased over 1.50 million ETH.\n\tRead more: Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tOn the other hand, the most important resistance barrier for Ethereum is between $3,940 and $4,054. Here, over 1.16 million addresses had previously purchased around 574,660 ETH.\n\tIf Ethereum overcomes this hurdle and prints a daily candlestick close above $4,170, the bearish outlook will be invalidated. This could result in a new upward countdown phase toward $5,000.\n\tEthereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilke’s recent transfer of 10,000 ETH to Kraken is indicative of broader market activities, where investors are moving significant amounts of ETH to exchanges. This trend aligns with increased trading activity, suggesting potential profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or market speculation among Ethereum holders. The balance of ETH on exchanges has spiked, indicating a potential rise in market volatility.\n\tThis market movement comes at a critical time, as the SEC is about to make a final ruling on Vaneck’s Ethereum ETF. Analysts have noted a substantial increase in the likelihood of approval, which has surged from 25% to 75%. Such regulatory developments are seen as a positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further institutional investment.\n\tRead more: How to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Everything You Need to Know\n\tDespite technical indicators suggesting a possible short-term bearish trend, the IOMAP indicator shows strong support levels for Ethereum. This suggests that while there may be short-term corrections, the underlying demand for Ethereum remains robust. Long-term holders appear confident, continuing to accumulate ETH, which bodes well for its future price stability and growth.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "time": "2024-05-24",
    "author": "Lynn Wang",
    "content": "\tThe crypto market awaits a significant event today—the liquidation of over $1 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options. This massive contract expiration is interesting, particularly due to the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\tAt the same time, approximately $1.42 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts will also expire. Can the expiration cause greater volatility in the market, and will it affect the price of the two leading cryptocurrencies?\n\tThe notional value of the 352,861 expiring Ethereum contracts is $1.33 billion. Data from Deribit indicates that Ethereum’s put-to-call ratio is 0.57. This ratio suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).\n\tFurthermore, the maximum pain point for these expiring Ethereum contracts is $3,200. The maximum pain point is the price at which the asset will cause the greatest number of holders’ financial losses.\n\tRead more: An Introduction to Crypto Options Trading\n\tBeInCrypto previously reported that before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially approved the spot Ethereum ETFs, crypto investors and traders showed optimism because analysts increased their approval odds from 25% to 75%. The renewed optimism is evident in ETH’s price, which increased nearly 20% after the analysts expressed their confidence.\n\tAhead of the approval, options trading tool provider Greeks.live shared their insights for the options market. Greeks.live analysts highlighted that BTC experienced a pullback as anticipated, contrasting sharply with the strong support observed for ETH’s price. They also noted that ETH’s current weekly weighted Implied Volatility (IV) still surpasses 100%, while BTC’s weekly IV stands at merely 50%.\n\t“The primary reason for this rare phenomenon is of course the uncertainty of the approval of the ETH ETFs. In the last two days there have been so many of these mega short-term spreads and calendar spreads that shows the market is extremely divergent. Judging by the structure of the market’s positions and the current IV structure, the current level of divergence has already exceeded that during the period of the ETH to PoS,” they explained.\n\tHowever, ETH’s price has been showing relatively muted performance post-approval. It has remained relatively stable in the last 24 hours and is trading at $3,806, marking an increase of 0.9%.\n\tIn addition to Ethereum options, 21,057 Bitcoin contracts will also expire. The tranche is slightly larger than the 18,183 settled expiring contracts settled last week. Today’s expiring Bitcoin contracts have a notional value of over $1.42 billion, a put-to-call ratio of 0.88, and a maximum pain point of $67,000.\n\tRead more: 9 Best Crypto Options Trading Platforms\n\tWhile option expirations can cause sharp price movements, the impact is usually temporary. The market generally stabilizes the next day, offsetting initial fluctuations. Nevertheless, traders should carefully analyze technical indicators and market sentiment before making investment decisions in this volatile environment.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tLayer-2 (L2) project Taiko has officially deployed its protocol on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, marking a significant milestone after two years of work.\n\tThe Taiko protocol uses Based Contestable Rollup (BCR) architecture. It promises to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and security while maintaining a decentralized structure.\n\tEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the inaugural block, highlighting the significance of this launch. He expressed his excitement about Taiko’s unique approach, which integrates various proof systems to bolster the network’s robustness.\n\t“I’m excited to see that Taiko is launching as a based rollup. Ethereum benefits from L2s taking a plurality of different approaches, and I appreciate them being among the first to go in this direction,” Buterin stated in the block’s metadata.\n\tRead more: A Beginner’s Guide to Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\tTaiko’s launch introduces several opportunities for users and developers to interact with the new network. Regular users can bridge ETH to Taiko using the official bridge and explore decentralized applications (dApps) for activities like swapping, borrowing, and staking. Although there are quota controls for bridging back to Ethereum, these limits will be gradually lifted.\n\tFurthermore, developers can engage by running nodes, proposing, and proving blocks—which are essential for maintaining the network’s security and functionality. The Taiko team will initially manage these processes to ensure stability but will soon open them to the broader community. Additionally, developers can build and deploy smart contracts on Taiko, which are supported by comprehensive documentation.\n\tThe team also plans to launch a DAO and transfer protocol control to token holders later in the year. TKO, Taiko’s native token, will launch a few weeks after the mainnet deployment. Taiko will hold an airdrop to distribute the token.\n\tSome user categories eligible for the airdrop include proposer, prover, developer, and bridger. GitHub and Loopring community members who meet the conditions can also check their eligibility for the airdrop.\n\tTaiko is a completely open-source, permissionless ZK-Rollup equivalent to Ethereum. Its goal is to offer an experience similar to Ethereum without the involvement of centralized parties, functioning entirely through community-driven mechanisms.\n\tRead more: Layer-2 Crypto Projects for 2024: The Top Picks\n\tThis technological accomplishment and user-focused approach have garnered significant financial backing.

    "content": "\tAccording to market analysts, Ethereum ETFs could make their debut by mid-June.\n\tThe newly approved funds aim to broaden Ethereum investment by allowing shares to be traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the cryptocurrency’s price movements.\n\tEight ETF applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity, received regulatory approval on May 23. Hashdex was the only issuer not green-lighted that day. However, the approval doesn’t mean the instruments will be available on the exchanges tomorrow: applicants must secure approved S-1 registration statements before trading begins.\n\tBloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests this process could take a few weeks, potentially up to five months. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts a mid-June launch.\n\t“My guess is there’s only one round of comments on the S-1s. And during BTC one round took two weeks ish. So I this mid-June is certainly poss. Just a guess, tho. We will see,” Balchunas said.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tVanEck quickly filed its amended S-1 after the 19b-4 approval, with other applicants expected to follow. Gabriel Shapiro from Delphi Labs notes that the SEC’s approval came from its Trading and Markets unit. A SEC commissioner can challenge this decision within ten days.\n\tExpectations for spot Ethereum ETFs are high. Seyffart predicts they could attract 20% of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ flows, while Balchunas estimates a conservative 10-15%. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows. Capturing 20% would mean spot ETH ETFs could see around $2.66 billion in inflows.\n\tHowever, the dynamics of the second most capitalized cryptocurrency are still far from bullish.

    "content": "\tIn an unprecedented move, the UK is scheduled to hold a general election on July 4, potentially upending the current Conservative government.\n\tThis event marks a pivotal moment for political and economic policies, especially concerning the cryptocurrency sector.\n\tPrime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the election date after discussions with the King.\n\t“Earlier today I spoke with His Majesty the King to request the dissolution of parliament. The King has granted this request, and we will have a general election on the 4th July,” Sunak said.\n\tUnder the Conservatives, the UK has aggressively pursued becoming a global crypto hub. This initiative has seen legislation integrating digital assets into the financial services sector, recognizing crypto as regulated entities. Additionally, new regulations on stablecoins and staking were anticipated, though these have yet to be proposed.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tFurthermore, the UK Law Commission has advocated for recognizing crypto-tokens and crypto-assets as a distinct category of personal property. This move aims to enhance the legal framework surrounding digital assets, ensuring that the law adapts to technological advancements.\n\tConsequently, the Commission suggests creating a multi-disciplinary panel to navigate crypto complexities and assist market participants in safeguarding their investments.\n\tDespite these advancements, the upcoming election casts uncertainty on the future of crypto in the UK. Current polls and prediction platforms like Polymarket strongly indicate a likely Labour victory, with Labour leader Keir Starmer poised to take the helm.\n\tLabour’s stance on crypto has been notably cautious. During a parliamentary debate, Labour Treasury spokeswoman Abena Oppong-Asare expressed skepticism about the future of crypto, reflecting a potentially cautious approach toward the sector if Labour assumes power.\n\tNevertheless, Labour’s broader financial strategy appears open to embracing fintech and innovation. Their proposed policies include advancing Open Banking, exploring Open Finance, and promoting the tokenization of securities along with a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Thus, while the party might pivot from the Conservative’s crypto-specific initiatives, it might not intend to stifle technological progress.\n\tRead more: What is Tokenization on Blockchain?\n\tThe election’s outcome could significantly influence the regulatory environment and market stability in the UK. While the Conservatives have laid a foundation for integrating crypto into mainstream finance, a potential Labour government could reshape the path forward, possibly focusing more on structured fintech innovations than crypto as a standalone sector.\n\tMoreover, in an interview with BeInCrypto, Cal Evans, an industry veteran and UK lawyer, stated that the elections are a good time for the crypto community members to make their voices heard.\n\t“The election is a great time to let the government know that Digital Assets and Crypto can be a hot topic.

    "content": "\tTron’s (TRX) price is seemingly set to face a potential decline as the altcoin failed to breach the resistance at $0.127.\n\tHowever, this could change since the investors are confident of potential gains, which could alter the direction of price action.\n\tTron’s price could be saved from a bearish outlook with the help of its investors. TRX holders continue to show faith in the asset as they refrain from selling any of their holdings. This has resulted in about 4% of the circulating supply, representing nearly 3.1 billion TRX, moving into long-term holders’ (LTHS) wallets.\n\tMid-term holders have not moved this $365 million supply for over a year, highlighting a significant shift. LTHs tend to be the most important cohort of any asset since they usually anchor the price during a bear market with their conviction.\n\tThe same outcome is expected at this moment as well.\n\tThis prevents any potential bearish development from strengthening, which may not occur anyway since the bearish sentiment is not strong enough.\n\tThe Average Directional Index (ADX) measures the strength of a trend in a financial market. A high ADX indicates a strong trend, while a low ADX suggests a weak trend or sideways movement.\n\tRead More: How To Buy TRON (TRX) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tIn the case of TRX, the ADX is well below the threshold of 25.0, suggesting a weak bearish trend. This may not strengthen should Tron’s price bounce back from the support at $0.115.\n\tTron’s price is trading at $0.118, moving closer to the crucial support of $0.115. This level is critical because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement. This Fib level, known as the bear market support floor, suggests massive corrections if the price falls below it.\n\tSince TRX holders seem confident of potential recovery, Tron’s price may not fall below this line. A bounce off into recovery is the more likely outcome, which would help the altcoin regain the support of 38.2% Fib.\n\tRead More: TRON (TRX) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tBut if Tron’s price falls below it, the drawdown could extend to $0.112. Losing this support would invalidate the bullish thesis, as the altcoin could fall to a four-month low of $0.107.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tIn a landmark decision, the US SEC has approved eight spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\tThis approval follows the first spot in Bitcoin ETFs, marking another milestone in the cryptocurrency market.\n\tThe SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for these ETFs. However, issuers still need approval for their S-1 registration statements, which might take weeks or months. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this process has historically taken over three months.\n\tThe SEC’s approval was unexpected due to the lack of prior interaction with the ETF issuers. The SEC’s sudden request for the 19b-4 forms has sparked speculation about the reasons for this shift.\n\tSome insiders suggest political pressure might have influenced this decision. Before the approval, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve these ETFs, arguing that the Bitcoin ETF approval set a precedent for Ethereum.\n\tIn response to the news of the approval, ETH’s price increased from $3,675 to $3,856. However, at the time of writing, it is now trading at $3,816.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tFollowing this announcement, stakeholders have expressed their expectations for further industry growth.

It proves that the capital markets are now getting involved in the crypto industry in earnest for some of their largest user bases and most widely used products,” Nazarov told BeInCrypto.\n\tHe also pointed out the significance of assets utilizing smart contracts being officially approved by the SEC.\n\t“One of the most important aspects of this ETF approval is the spotlight it places on the potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which are critical use cases for Ethereum.

    "content": "\tMicroStrategy executive chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor appears to be reassessing his stance on Ethereum after the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\tIn the latest episode of the “What Bitcoin Did For Me” podcast, Saylor called the SEC’s decision positive news for Bitcoin and the entire crypto industry.\n\tAccording to Saylor, the SEC’s recent approval of several Ethereum ETFs showed the crypto industry’s growing political influence. Last week, the financial regulator unexpectedly approved several ETH-related financial instruments, with many industry insiders suggesting this reversal might have political motivations.\n\tAs such, several stakeholders suggested the approval highlighted a positive shift in President Joe Biden’s stance towards cryptocurrencies.\n\t“Is this good for Bitcoin or not? Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin, in fact, I think it may be better for Bitcoin because I think that we are politically much more powerful and supported by the entire crypto industry,” Saylor said.\n\tMichael Saylor believes the Ethereum ETFs will boost the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to him, more institutions will now recognize crypto as a legitimate asset class and allocate capital across various cryptocurrencies. However, he maintains Bitcoin would receive the largest share of these investments as the “leader” of the market.\n\t“I think mainstream investors will say oh there is a crypto asset class now, maybe we’ll allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% or 70% of that,” Saylor noted.\n\tRead more: Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2024?\n\tThe MicroStrategy chairman also seized the opportunity to express confidence in Bitcoin’s future.

Earlier, he stated that the SEC would classify ETH as a security under its regulatory purview. He predicted that other cryptos, including BNB, Solana, and XRP, would suffer the same fate.\n\t“None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” he claimed.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tVanEck, a leading New York-based fund group managing approximately $100 billion in assets, spearheads a significant debate on the approval process for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\tThe firm, which first filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in 2021, advocates for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to honor the order of filings.\n\tMatthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of crypto research, has voiced concerns about the SEC’s current approach. The SEC currently permits multiple firms to launch their financial product, such as ETFs, simultaneously, regardless of when they filed. The regulator followed this approach and allowed the launch of all the spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11.\n\t“We were first to file and we expect to be first to respond to comments and first out the door. When you filed used to mean something, and it should again,” Sigel stated in an X space.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tMoreover, Sigel contends that respecting the filing queue is a matter of fairness and essential for maintaining orderly market practices.\n\t“It creates an uneven playing field for issuers who filed earlier and had to wait longer. Those who filed months ago had to keep their applications updated and compliant for a longer period, incurring more costs and legal fees compared to later filers,” Sigel argued.\n\tThis issue comes to a head as the SEC’s 240-day review period for VanEck’s latest ether ETF bid concludes today. This is just a day before the commission is scheduled to make a decision on similar proposals by Ark Invest and 21Shares.\n\tNotably, until last week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck anticipated potential rejection for their spot Ethereum ETF. He noted that despite being pioneers, both VanEck and Ark Invest are likely facing rejection.\n\tHowever, the tides have changed since the beginning of the current week. This is because Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently upgraded the chances of approval for spot Ethereum ETFs from 25% to a hopeful 75%.\n\tSimilarly, prediction platforms like Polymarket have shown a significant increase in the odds of approval, which rose from 10% to 58% last week.\n\tRead more: How to Invest in Ethereum ETFs?\n\tAdditionally, the SEC has requested revisions to the spot Ethereum ETF proposals from Nasdaq and Cboe, a move seen as a crucial step towards potential approval.

According to DeFiLlama data, this surge brought Aave’s TVL to $13.33 billion, which marks the highest level since May 2022.\n\tThe increase is largely attributed to the positive market sentiment surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\tThe AAVE token has also seen a notable increase, rising 13% over the past week.

The company’s performance exceeded expectations for both sales and earnings, resulting in a significant rise in its stock price.\n\tThe company’s performance highlights the ongoing robust demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, with notable gains in its data center sales and networking parts.\n\tNvidia reported revenue of $26.04 billion, surpassing the expected $24.65 billion. The chipmaker also saw a significant increase in net income, reaching $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share. In comparison, in Q1 2023, Nvidia’s net income was $2.04 billion, or $0.82 per share.\n\tNvidia’s data center category, including AI chips and components for AI servers, saw a 427% increase in revenue to $22.56 billion. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), attributed this growth to shipments of Hopper graphics processors, including the H100 GPU. She highlighted Meta’s Lama 3 announcement, which utilized 24,000 H100 GPUs, as a key driver.\n\tRead more: Top 9 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Cryptocurrencies in 2024\n\tNetworking revenue also surged, reaching $3.17 billion, over three times higher than Q1 on the previous year. Nvidia’s InfiniBand products significantly contributed to this growth by supporting the connection of vast chip clusters.\n\tAdditionally, Nvidia’s gaming revenue rose 18% to $2.65 billion, driven by strong demand for its hardware. The company also reported $427 million in professional visualization sales and $329 million in automotive sales.\n\tCEO Jensen Huang emphasized that demand for Nvidia’s AI chips remains robust. The company anticipates revenue from its next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, later this year.\n\tAccording to its official website, the Blackwell GPU architecture features six transformative technologies for accelerated computing. These technologies will help unlock breakthroughs in data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design, quantum computing, and generative AI.\n\t“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI,” Huang said.\n\tNvidia repurchased $7.7 billion of shares during the quarter and paid $98 million in dividends.

Split-adjusted trading will begin on June 10, 2024.\n\tNvidia also increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 to $0.10 per share on a pre-split basis. Post-split, the dividend will be $0.01 per share. Looking ahead, Nvidia projects $28 billion in revenue for this quarter.\n\tNVDA’s price skyrocketed after the announcement, surpassing the $1,000 mark.

    "content": "\tFormer US President Donald Trump recently made headlines due to his bold political moves, particularly his continuous support for the crypto industry.\n\tThis support sparked a surge in meme coins inspired by him, leading to fantastic gains in the market.\n\tMAGA (MAGA), a meme coin inspired by Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again,” increased by approximately 162% in the last 24 hours. DEX Screener data reveals it is now trading at $0.0006501.\n\tThe on-chain tracker platform Lookonchain reported that a crypto trader made $2.7 million in just three days by trading MAGA. They achieved a return on investment (ROI) of 505%.\n\tThe trader initially spent $537,500 to buy 6 billion MAGA on May 24 and 25, then sold 1.5 billion MAGA for 744,000 USDT to take profits. Currently, the trader holds 4.5 billion MAGA, valued at $2.51 million.\n\tRead more: 11 Top Solana Meme Coins to Watch in May 2024\n\tAdditionally, MAGA’s spinoff on the Solana network recorded an extraordinary increase of 534,000% over the same period. At the time of writing, it is trading at $0.1811 with a market capitalization of $8.5 million.\n\tA notable increase in these meme coins might be attributed to Trump’s latest political move. As BeInCrypto reported earlier this weekend, Trump made several pro-crypto statements before the upcoming election. He strongly supported the crypto industry, emphasizing that the US must strive to be a global leader in this growing sector.\n\t“I will ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be made in the USA. I will support the right to self-custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders,” he stated.\n\tRemarkably, the former US president also pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the operator of Silk Road, if re-elected. Trump promised to commute Ulbricht’s sentence to time served on his first day in office.\n\tFor the past months, Trump has been making crypto-focused political campaigns, such as hosting an exclusive dinner with the non-fungible token (NFT) community. Moreover, Trump has accepted cryptocurrency campaign donations, including Bitcoin (BTC).\n\tTrump’s political shift is particularly noteworthy, given that he was a crypto skeptic during his prior presidency. Many believe that Trump aims to take advantage of President Joe Biden’s administration’s tougher actions toward the crypto industry. A recent survey from investment firm Paradigm reveals that 48% of crypto owners plan to vote for Trump, 39% for Biden, and 13% undecided.\n\tRead more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024\n\t“Notably, among crypto owners, 43% recall voting for President Biden in 2020 and just 39% of crypto voters recall voting for former President Trump that year. So it appears some of the voters President Biden is now losing to Trump are owners of crypto, possibly because of actions taken by some agencies in the Biden Administration,” the report reads.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

According to the Network Realized Profit/Loss indicator, the overall gains have been inclining for the past month.\n\tRealized profits are a sign that the investors are selling, and this could now intensify as the meme coin hits a new ATH.

The MVRV ratio monitors investor profits and losses. With PEPE’s 30-day MVRV at 38%, indicating profit, selling may ensue.\n\tHistorically, the meme coin has undergone corrections at MVRV levels of 15% to 36%, marking it as a danger zone.

Intense selling could extend this decline and PEPE could dip to the 61.8% Fib line at $0.00001146.\n\tThis line is known to be a bull market support floor, so losing it would wipe away a chunk of the recent profits.\n\tRead More: Pepe (PEPE) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tBut if PEPE bounces off this support floor, the meme coin could have a shot at reinitiating recovery.

The reason behind this is the lack of conviction among TON holders, which was visible in the downtick of the Mean Coin Age.\n\tMean Coin Age is a blockchain metric that calculates the average age of all coins by considering the time each coin has remained in its current address.

    "content": "\tIn a significant move to combat online fraud, several prominent tech companies have formed a coalition named “Tech Against Scams.”\n\tThis group aims to tackle the rising tide of online scams, particularly romance scams, by fostering collaboration and sharing intelligence across industries.\n\tThe coalition includes major players such as Coinbase, Match Group (parent company of Tinder and Hinge), Meta, Kraken, Ripple, Gemini, and the Global Anti-Scam Organization. By joining forces, these companies aim to create a unified front against the sophisticated tactics used by scammers. Their efforts will focus on sharing best practices, threat intelligence, and strategies to educate and protect users.\n\t“Scammers often use multiple platforms to pull off their fraud, so a united front encompassing social media, dating apps, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency platforms significantly enhances our ability to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities,” Ronghui Gu, co-founder of blockchain security platform CertiK told BeInCrypto.\n\tRomance scams have become increasingly prevalent. Fraudsters use fake identities to build relationships with potential victims through text messages, social media platforms, or dating apps.\n\tRead more: 15 Most Common Crypto Scams To Look Out For\n\tAfter establishing trust, scammers introduce the idea of crypto investments. Eventually, they persuade victims to transfer funds to accounts under the scammers’ control. This process is often referred to as “pig butchering,” highlighting the gradual, systematic exploitation of victims.\n\tIn response to these threats, Tech Against Scams plans to disrupt the tools and methods fraudsters use. This will make it harder for them to operate.\n\t“Fraud schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring a greater emphasis on the importance of industry leaders coming together to tackle fraud and secure a safer digital environment for users. We are dedicated to disrupting emerging online scams through collaboration, information sharing, and enhanced consumer education,” Philip Martin, Chief Security Officer at Coinbase, said.\n\tBeInCrypto reported a recent example of the impact of these scams on May 18. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested two Chinese nationals, Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang, for orchestrating a romance scam that led to the laundering of at least $73 million.\n\tThe DOJ’s investigation revealed extensive coordination between the conspirators. This included communications discussing the scheme’s logistics and the use of various shell companies to facilitate money laundering.

This development suggests potential upward momentum, especially if Bitcoin continues its rise to $73,000. A successful cloud penetration could propel LTC towards the crucial resistance level at $93.\n\tThe Ichimoku cloud provides additional support around the $85.70 level. Staying above this cloud is important for sustaining the bullish trend. A break below the cloud could lead to increased selling pressure and a potential reversal of the recent gains.\n\t$85.09 (38.2% Fibonacci Level): This level serves as the first line of defense for LTC. A break below this support could signal a weakening of the bullish trend and might lead to further downward pressure.\n\tRead More: How To Buy Litecoin (LTC) and Everything You Need To Know\n\t$83.74 (50% Fibonacci Level): The 50% retracement level is a critical support zone. Holding above this level is crucial for maintaining a bullish outlook.

If LTC fails to sustain above 82.40, it could invalidate the current bullish momentum and shift the market sentiment\n\tIf LTC breaks through the Ichimoku cloud, the next significant resistance to watch is $93. This level could see substantial selling pressure. Conversely, a break below the Tenkan plateau of $81 could signal a potential trend reversal, necessitating caution.\n\tThe Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) for Litecoin are above 1, indicating that more LTC transactions are occurring at a profit. This is a strong bullish indicator as it reflects positive market sentiment and fundamental strength.\n\tSOPR Analysis: Litecoin’s SOPR has consistently stayed above the 1.0 threshold, showing that holders are selling at a profit. This aligns with recent price movements and suggests continuing bullish trends.\n\taSOPR Analysis: Similarly, the aSOPR confirms the same bullish sentiment.

    "author": "Adam Mourad",
    "content": "\tIn this analysis, we will examine the price action of Dogecoin (DOGE) using technical analysis.\n\tTo understand the current market dynamics and provide strategic insights, we’ll focus on the role of the Ichimoku cloud, the Tenkan-sen (red line), and the 100 EMA (blue line).\n\tThe price of DOGE is currently trading between the Tenkan-sen and the 100 EMA in the 4H timeframe. After attempting to Tenkan plateau (in red) of the 4H Ichimoku cloud located at $0.16, DOGE failed to sustain the upward movement, indicating a bearish development.\n\tThe 4H – 100 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is a critical mid-term support level.\n\tThe Ichimoku Cloud, or Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a comprehensive indicator used in technical analysis. It defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum, and provides trading signals.\n\tIt consists of five lines, with the Tenkan-sen being the most important. The Tenkan-sen is crucial for determining price trends and identifying key support and resistance levels, especially when it flattens to form a plateau.\n\tThe daily Ichimoku cloud is an important resistance level that DOGE needs to overcome to shift the outlook to bullish. The price is attempting to exit to the downside of the daily Ichimoku cloud, which would reinforce the bearish sentiment.\n\tIf the price remains below this level, it may continue to face downward pressure.\n\tThe market capitalization of Dogecoin (DOGE) fluctuates around an important range (20 to 30 Billion USD), as illustrated in the provided chart. Understanding the implications of this fluctuation is crucial for anticipating future market movements and potential bearish developments.\n\tThis range acts as a crucial zone of support and resistance, influencing the price dynamics of DOGE.\n\tIf DOGE’s market cap fails to maintain its position within this critical range and drops significantly. This could trigger a bearish trend. This drop would indicate a lack of investor confidence and could lead to increased selling pressure. Such a scenario might result in DOGE’s price declining further as the market seeks a new lower support level.\n\tMonitor Key Levels: Watch the $20 billion market cap as a critical psychological level. If the market cap falls below this, look for support around $16 billion. Key resistance levels to watch are $25 billion and $30 billion. Technical supports to monitor include the daily 100 EMA (blue line) at $0.14606 and the daily Tenkan-sen (red line) at $0.14735.\n\tPrice Reversal Scenario: A bullish reversal could be signaled if Dogecoin’s market cap reclaims and sustains above $25 billion, along with a strong price movement breaking above the $0.18 mark and the daily Ichimoku cloud on the daily timeframe.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Their sentiment suggests that selling is the likely outcome, as substantiated by the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.\n\tThe MVRV ratio assesses investor profit or loss.

Historically, ARB corrections occur within the 7% to 24% MVRV range, labeling it a danger zone.\n\tFurther cementing this outlook is the fact that investors are realizing profits. As ARB rallied over the past week, rising by 20%, it also brought the first bout of gains noted in almost a month.\n\tRealized losses turned into realized profits across the network and will likely continue rising. This is only possible via selling, and ARB investors could opt to secure their gains before another dip occurs.\n\tRead More: What Is Arbitrum?\n\tThus, Arbitrum’s price is prone to a decline.\n\tArbitrum’s price breached through the month-long resistance of $1.17, and the altcoin is currently changing hands at $1.18.

Additional participation came from Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z, Haun Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Variant, and Standard Crypto.

The unexpected rally was fuelled by broader market cues and the spot Ethereum ETF approval. ENS benefited from it, given the token is an Ethereum namesake.\n\tHowever, this also resulted in the asset being overvalued, as exhibited by the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.

This is because they are rather active on the network despite the lower price for the last 72 hours.\n\tUpon observing active addresses by profitability, it can be observed that the investors in profit have sizeable dominance. More than 25%, and at times over 30%, of the participating addresses happen to be in profit.\n\tThis is concerning because the high participation from these investors during bearish conditions suggests potential selling. Profit-taking could be the likely motivation, and should FTM holders offload their assets, Fantom’s price could take a hit.\n\tThis sentiment is further substantiated by the lack of incentive that potential investors are noting at the moment. The downtick noted in network growth suggests that Fantom is losing traction in the market.\n\tRead More: What Is Fantom (FTM)?\n\tThe metric measures the rate at which new addresses are formed, and in the case of FTM, this rate is at an eight-month low.

To make it worse, it also fell through the 61.8% Fib level, which is known as the bull market support floor.

    "time": "2024-05-23",
    "author": "Lynn Wang",
    "content": "\tOn Wednesday, the crypto industry achieved a historic milestone as the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).\n\tThe bill, which aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, was approved with bipartisan support in a 279-136 vote. This marks a significant step towards legal clarity in the crypto space.\n\tWith 71 Democrats joining 208 Republicans in favor, the passage signals a growing consensus on the need for clear crypto regulations. Introduced in July 2023, the bill aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrencies. It also establishes guidelines for various aspects of the crypto market, including token issuance, trading, and custody.\n\tSeveral legislators have expressed their strong support for the bill’s passage. Congressman John Rose highlighted the need to move away from regulation by enforcement.\n\t“I’ve had enough of Biden Administration officials regulating by enforcement. That’s why I support FIT21, legislation that will prevent the government from standing in the way of digital innovation. The bill includes critical guardrails that will protect consumers and foster innovation,” Congressman Rose said.\n\tAdditionally, Representative Wiley Nickel stressed the importance of establishing a modern regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique nature of digital assets.\n\t“FIT21 provides a clear regulatory framework for digital assets instead of relying on 90-year-old securities law written before the Internet existed. That’s a big deal. Whether you love or hate crypto, you should support regulation,” Representative Nickel stated.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tIndustry leaders echoed this enthusiasm. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, praised the bipartisan support for FIT21 and criticized the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation.\n\t“Today, more than ever, we are seeing what a political liability Gensler has been to the Biden administration. It’s the reason we saw 71 Democrats cross the aisle and support FIT21. We are just getting started!” Garlinghouse wrote on his X (Twitter) account.\n\tJake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant, also shared his perspectives regarding the bill’s passage. He sees it as a vote of no confidence in the SEC’s current stance on crypto.\n\t“House Democrats voting in favor of this bill: 71. That is a huge number of elected Democrats voting ‘no confidence’ in the current SEC, and sending a message to the Biden administration that ‘anti-crypto’ is a losing platform this year,” he said.\n\tNischal Shetty, co-founder of Shardeum, believes the passage of FIT21 has broader implications for the Web3 ecosystem. According to Shetty, the regulatory clarity provided by the FIT21 Act could encourage wider cryptocurrency adoption and an expansion of the Web3 industry.\n\t“With the clarity and support provided by initiatives like FIT21, we can expect a significant boost in adoption, which will naturally lead to better tax laws and regulatory frameworks,” Shetty told BeInCrypto.\n\tDespite the significant progress in the House, FIT21 faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A counterpart bill is currently absent.\n\tMoreover, the necessary committees have yet to engage in the same level of work on crypto. This makes the path forward less certain.\n\tYet, the White House has expressed its opposition to the bill, citing concerns about consumer and investor protections. The administration acknowledges the need for a regulatory framework for digital assets. However, they believe FIT21 requires additional safeguards in its current form.\n\t“The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration,” the White House wrote.\n\tHowever, President Joe Biden’s statement did not mention a veto threat. This contrasts with his stance on another crypto-related bill, Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).\n\tBeInCrypto previously reported that SEC Chair Gary Gensler also voiced strong opposition to the bill before the House vote. He argued that it weakens SEC oversight and warned that it could increase investor risks and harm US markets.\n\tRead more: How Does Regulation Impact Crypto Marketing? A Complete Guide\n\tDespite the opposition, the passage marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing effort to provide clear regulations for the crypto industry in the US. With the FIT21 Act now in the Senate’s hands, the industry is watching closely to see if it will become law. Nevertheless, this development will potentially transform the regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

Scam Sniffer, a Web3 anti-scam firm, reported that the investor was tricked into signing a malicious Permit phishing signature.\n\tThis authorization led to the theft of 1,807 Ether.fi-Liquid1 tokens, valued at $6.9 million. Moreover, blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that the same investor fell victim to a phishing attack last year, losing $638,000.\n\tThe scam involved using a permit function, allowing an off-chain authorization signature to execute transactions on another address’s behalf. This method enabled the transfer of tokens without on-chain transactions, facilitating the theft.\n\tThe theft involved two wallets, 0xE56978, from the scammer and 0xFC4EA, belonging to a drainer. Notably, the stolen funds remain within these addresses.\n\tMeanwhile, MistTrack, a crypto tracking and compliance platform built by SlowMist, found connections to the Pink and Inferno Drainers, notorious draining-as-a-service (DAAS) providers in the theft. The drainers offer scammers tools for phishing exploits, such as fake social media accounts and websites, in exchange for a cut of the stolen funds. BeInCrypto reported that these services were used to steal $295 million from 324,000 victims in 2023.\n\t“Another huge amount of phishing, nearly 7 million USD of ETH pledged assets… from the old phishing gang Inferno Drainer.

Initially a light-hearted joke, Dogecoin quickly evolved to become one of the top crypto assets. Moreover, it spurred the creation of a whole genre of dog-themed tokens, including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI).\n\tOn May 24, Sato shared a poignant description of Kabosu’s final hours.\n\t“Kabochan passed away in a deep sleep at 7:50 AM on May 24. Last night, as usual, she ate her food and drank plenty of water. Soft light streamed through the window. And on a beautiful morning when birds were singing outside, she passed away gently while being stroked by me,” Sato wrote.\n\tThis event has touched the hearts of many, extending far beyond the crypto community.\n\tFollowing Kabosu’s passing, the crypto market reacted significantly. Within minutes, Dogecoin’s value surged by nearly 10%, climbing from $0.15614 to $0.17089. Termed a “tribute pump,” this surge reflects the community’s deep connection to Kabosu.\n\tConcurrently, DexTools data shows that various Kabosu-themed meme coins have surged in value. Some saw their values increase by over 186%.\n\tRead more: How To Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tThe reaction to Kabosu’s demise has been mixed. Some see the rapid market response as a fitting tribute to the meme legend.\n\tHowever, others ridiculed the idea of trading the death of a beloved pet. Nonetheless, Kabosu’s impact on internet culture and the crypto sector remains profound.\n\tAs the crypto community mourns, it also celebrates the innovation and joy sparked by one dog’s unforgettable expression.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tThe preliminary approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has sparked renewed enthusiasm in the crypto market.\n\tThis development has led to significant gains for Ethereum (ETH) and several altcoins within its ecosystem, such as PEPE and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), over the past 24 hours. This signals strong investor confidence and optimism about the future of Ethereum-based assets.\n\tEthereum’s price surged to $3,910, inching closer to the critical $4,000 mark. This represents a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen sees a bullish outlook for Ethereum’s long-term price trajectory.\n\t“ETH [1-week chart] showing strong hidden bullish divergence too! While the price makes higher highs, the momentum indicator (RSI) makes lower lows,” Van Lagen explained.\n\tAnalysts at crypto trading firm QCP Capital also shared their perspective on Ethereum’s recent surge. They said that ETH has strong support at $3,000. The analysts attributed potential institutional interest once the spot Ethereum ETF debuts as one reason.\n\t“While we are structurally positive ETH, we don’t see a major breakout until we have more clarity on the S-1 approvals and get some inflow data, which should only be a matter of time,” they explained.\n\tIt is important to note that issuers must obtain approval for both 19-4b and S-1 forms to officially launch ETFs in the market. The recent SEC approval was only for the 19-4b forms. Analysts predict that the S-1 approval might come somewhere in June.\n\tAdditionally, altcoins in the Ethereum network have shown impressive growth, with PEPE rising by 13.5% and ENS increasing by 9.4%. They are now trading at $0.00001679 and $26.05, respectively.\n\tEthereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has also experienced a surge. DefiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi is $66.61 billion as of May 27, marking its highest TVL since mid-May 2022.\n\tRead more: Which Are the Best Altcoins To Invest in May 2024?\n\tDespite the renewed interest, the market has not yet entered an altcoin season (altseason). According to the Altcoin Season Index, only 35% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. To enter the altseason, the market needs 75% of altcoins to outperform Bitcoin.\n\tRead more: What Is Altcoin Season? A Comprehensive Guide\n\tIn addition to the optimism from the ETF approval, Ethereum developers have announced the upcoming “Pectra” upgrade for Q1 2025. This update will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which includes about 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EOF aims to improve the EVM code with an opt-in container system, marking a significant advancement in Ethereum’s development.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tSolana (SOL) broke out of an ascending channel in a downtrend on May 20, and its value has since declined by 13%.\n\tAs the altcoin’s price aims to cross below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), SOL is put at risk of further decline as selling pressure continues to increase.\n\tThe double-digit decline in SOL’s price in the past three days has pushed it toward its 20-day EMA. Poised to cross below the key average, this would signal a surge in SOL sell-offs among market participants.\n\tAn asset’s 20-day EMA is a short-term moving average that reacts quickly to price changes. It reflects the average closing price of an asset over the past 20 days.\n\tWhen an asset falls below this moving average, it is a bearish signal because it means that the asset’s current price is less than its average price of the past 20 days. It is regarded as a shift toward coin distribution.\n\tThe decline in SOL’s Money Flow Index (MFI) confirmed the surge in bearish influence. This indicator measures the buying and selling pressure behind SOL’s price movement.\n\tRead More: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tAt press time, SOL’s MFI rested under its 50-neutral line at 48.84, suggesting that selling activity outpaced buying momentum among market participants.\n\tThe decline in SOL’s price in the past few days has led to a surge in long liquidations in the altcoin’s derivatives market. Between May 20 and 23, over-leveraged SOL traders lost $19 million.\n\tLiquidations happen when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it.\n\tLong liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly drops, forcing traders who have open positions in favor of a price rally to exit their positions.\n\tInterestingly, despite this, SOL futures traders continue to demand more long positions.

    "time": "2024-05-23",
    "author": "Adam Mourad",
    "content": "\tIn a previous article, BeInCrypto predicted the Bitcoin price surge to $72,000, supported by our comprehensive analysis of on-chain metrics.\n\tBeInCrypto prediction is validated by the recent price movement, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis of these indicators.\n\tBy analyzing key indicators such as Hash Ribbons and the 90-day Moving Average of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), we can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics.\n\tThis continuous monitoring approach is crucial for making informed decisions and highlights the importance of keeping up with expert analyses like those from BeInCrypto.\n\tHash Ribbons are a powerful metric that identifies when BTC miners are capitulating or giving up and when they are starting to recover. Miners are essential for securing the Bitcoin network by solving complex transaction validation problems.\n\tWhen mining becomes unprofitable, miners may shut down their machines, causing the network’s hash rate to drop.\n\tThe chart highlights periods where the 30-day moving average exceeds the 60-day moving average, indicating miner capitulation. These periods often precede significant price recoveries.\n\tIn the early part of 2023, the chart shows a capitulation phase, followed by a recovery where the 30-day average crosses above the 60-day average. This crossover aligns with the recent price surge to $73,000, validating the effectiveness of the Hash Ribbons indicator in predicting market bottoms.\n\tCoin Days Destroyed (CDD) measures the activity of long-term BTC holders.\n\tEach Bitcoin accumulates “coin days,” for every day it remains untouched. When it is finally moved, these coin days are “destroyed.” This metric helps identify significant shifts in market sentiment among long-term holders.\n\tCDD is calculated by multiplying the amount of Bitcoin moved by the number of days it was held. The 90-day SMA smooths out daily fluctuations, providing a clearer view of long-term trends.\n\tThe 90-day SMA of CDD has shown a steady increase in 2023, indicating growing activity among long-term holders.\n\tHowever, recent decreases in CDD indicate reduced selling pressure from long-term holders, suggesting confidence in continued price appreciation. This aligns with the recent bullish momentum in Bitcoin’s price, further supporting our analysis.\n\tThe Short-Term Holders Realized Price to Price Ratio (STH RP/PR) is an innovative indicator identifying potential buy signals during bull markets. This metric compares the realized price daily change of short-term holders to the current market price, highlighting periods of negative sentiment as potential buying opportunities.\n\tNegative STH RP/PR values suggest that short-term holders capitulate, often marking good entry points for new investments.\n\tWe can observe that the Short-Term Holders’ Realized Price-to-Price Ratio (STH RP/PR) increased during Bitcoin’s appreciation to $72,000. This suggests that the price could continue to rise, as short-term holders, on average, are not facing unrealized losses relative to the current BTC price.\n\tOn-chain data and Bitcoin fundamentals indicate a looming bull run. A sustained break above the $73,000 resistance level could easily propel the price to $82,000.\n\tObviously, a sustained drop below $68,000 could reverse market trends, but the likelihood of this happening is diminishing. As highlighted in previous BeInCrypto analyses, the majority of on-chain data has shown positive signals for weeks.\n\tBeInCrypto will continuously monitor these metrics and provide updates to keep you informed about key market movements and opportunities. Stay tuned for detailed future outlooks and strategic insights.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tFormer US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his support for the cryptocurrency industry, expressing a strong commitment to its growth.\n\tOn May 25, the former president made several pro-crypto statements before the November election.\n\tDonald Trump strongly supported the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing that the United States must strive to be a global leader in this growing sector.\n\t“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump stated.\n\tHe further contrasted his stance with that of President Joe Biden, whom he accused of wanting to stifle the crypto industry. “That will never happen with me,” Trump asserted. Later, at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington, Trump told attendees that he would protect their right to self-custody crypto assets and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\t“I will support the right to self-custody. To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” Trump addded.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tRemarkably, the former President also pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht if re-elected. In 2015, a court sentenced Ulbricht to two consecutive life terms plus 40 years for creating and operating Silk Road, a darknet marketplace primarily used for drug transactions. However, many in the crypto community argue that Ulbricht’s sentence represents a governmental overreach.\n\t“If you vote for me, on Day one, I will commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to time served. He’s already served 11 years, and we’re going to get him home,” Trump promised.\n\tMeanwhile, Trump’s pro-crypto stance appears to be enhancing his election prospects. According to Polymarket, a popular crypto-based prediction platform, Donald Trump has a 56% chance of winning the election, compared to Biden’s 38%.\n\tTrump’s chances increased substantially over the past months following a series of pro-crypto actions and statements. Notably, his campaign has begun accepting crypto donations in various digital assets, including Bitcoin, making him the first major candidate to do so.\n\tRead more: How To Donate Crypto Using The Giving Block\n\tIn response, the Biden administration has noticeably shifted its approach to crypto.

    "content": "\tMetaMask, a leading self-custodial wallet, plans to integrate support for Bitcoin (BTC). Known for its dominance in the Ethereum ecosystem, this move could enhance MetaMask’s appeal to a broader crypto audience.\n\tThe integration aligns with the broader trend of interoperability in the blockchain space, promising a more versatile and user-friendly experience for crypto enthusiasts.\n\tAlthough the exact timeline remains uncertain, sources suggest users might see Bitcoin functionality within the next month. Initially, features might be limited and expanded over time.\n\t“We’re excited about MetaMask’s commitment to embracing the multi-chain world of Web3 and continually exploring new integrated features to enhance the usability and security of the leading self-custodial wallet. While we can’t confirm any timeline for specific developments at this time, we’re always working on innovations to serve our users better. Stay tuned for further updates when we’re ready to share more,” a MetaMask spokesperson stated.\n\tRead more: A Complete Guide to Using MetaMask\n\tCurrently, MetaMask does not provide direct support for the Bitcoin blockchain. Users who wish to make Bitcoin-related transactions in MetaMask have to either use Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an ERC-20 standard token representing Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, or use MetaMask’s feature—Snaps.\n\tIn September 2023, BeInCrypto reported that MetaMask announced the launch of Snaps. This feature enables users to integrate applications with non-native blockchains and tokens, including Bitcoin.\n\tWhile Snaps enables users to manage their BTC within the MetaMask interface, developers must initially set up and understand Bitcoin. Thus, having native Bitcoin support would make the process more straightforward for users.\n\tMetaMask is also favored by non-fungible token (NFT) enthusiasts. Consequently, MetaMask’s integration with Bitcoin is anticipated to facilitate users’ storage of Ordinals.\n\tOrdinals are satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) minted and embedded with unique information, such as text, images, or other digital assets. This essentially mirrors a Bitcoin adaptation of NFTs.\n\tShould MetaMask integration to Bitcoin come to fruition, it could also enhance the Ordinals holders’ experience. Juanse, an active Bitcoin’s Ordinal community member, expressed his enthusiasm about this news.\n\t“I don’t care what you think about MetaMask, they’re the wallet with the most active users in the world.

    "content": "\tAptos (APT) blockchain achieved a new record by processing 116 million transactions on May 25. This remarkable volume significantly outpaced Solana, which logged 31.9 million transactions the same day.\n\tA key driver of this surge was the instant hit tap-to-earn game Tapos Cat. It accounted for 10 million transactions on its launch day alone.\n\tData from Aptoscan reveals that Aptos reached an all-time high of 32,000 transactions per second (TPS) on that day. Consequently, this achievement showcases Aptos’s robust capacity and also its expanding reach and adoption amidst layer-1 platforms.\n\tTapos Cat’s gameplay is simple. Players can earn HEART tokens by interacting with a virtual cat. This process involves multiple transactions, significantly boosting the total transaction count.\n\tAdditionally, the game attracted more players by eliminating gas fees for the first 72 hours, removing any financial barrier to entry.\n\tRead more: Aptos Crypto (APT): A Guide to What it Is and How it Works\n\tThis strategy of incorporating gamification within blockchain technology is gaining popularity. For example, the Notcoin (NOT) game within the Toncoin ecosystem launched on January 1, 2024, through Telegram, features a similar tap-to-earn model.\n\tIt gained more popularity after airdropping 5% of NOT supply to more than 500,000 members of its community.\n\tSuch games are pivotal not just for increasing transaction volumes but also for enhancing user engagement. They attract diverse users, including those who might not typically engage with crypto. The introduction of games like Tapos Cat and Notcoin marks a shift in how people interact with blockchain technologies, making the experience both fun and rewarding.\n\tThe record-breaking transaction volume has propelled Aptos beyond the previous high of over 65 million transactions set by the Sui Network, as reported by BeInCrypto in July 2023. However, Sui’s transactions have since reduced to 13.7 million, prompting speculation about Aptos’s ability to sustain such high activity levels.\n\tOn the financial front, the Aptos token is approaching a potential market breakout from an inverse head and shoulder pattern, a bullish indicator suggesting a likely reversal from the recent downtrend.\n\t“The user transaction number of Aptos hit a record high, and I am expecting this to have a bullish effect on APT price in the long term,” crypto analyst CryptoJack said.\n\tShould the price breakout from the neckline at $9.33, the token’s price could see an increase to $11.32. This suggests an over 22% surge from APT’s current position.\n\tRead more: Aptos (APT) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tIf the breakout does not materialize, APT might find support at approximately $8.72.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tAll the information contained on our website is published in good faith and for general information purposes only.

This landmark bill aims to provide regulatory clarity and support innovation within the financial sector despite opposition from the White House and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\n\tSenators Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand have introduced legislation designed to balance financial innovation with consumer protections. Following the FIT21 vote, Lummis posted a picture with Bitcoin laser eyes, symbolizing the resurgence of pro-crypto sentiment in Congress.\n\t“Senator Gillibrand and I have worked tirelessly to craft a crypto asset bill that provides commonsense solutions to unleash financial innovation without eroding consumer protections,” Lummis said.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tRecently, both the Senate and the House voted to overturn the SEC’s controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which imposed strict rules on financial institutions seeking to become crypto custodians.

However, the case is the opposite this time since the altcoin established a market top this week.\n\tA market top is the highest point of a security’s price before a significant decline, indicating a peak in bullish activity. Generally, this is followed by corrections as the market cools down, along with selling at the hands of investors.\n\tThis can be confirmed if the total supply in profit ends up being more than 95% of the circulating supply. Such is the case with FET, as 95.3% of the supply is in profit. Thus, a market top has already been formed for Fetch.ai’s price.\n\tThus, profit-taking is likely, and based on investors’ behavior, this pattern could be followed.\n\tFurther substantiating this thesis is the Price Daily Active Addresses (DAA) Divergence.

    "content": "\tJustin Sun, the founder of layer-1 blockchain TRON, has urged the crypto community to back a US presidential candidate who supports the digital assets industry.\n\tSun’s recent statement follows other prominent figures in the industry who have already voiced similar messages.\n\tIn a recent X (Twitter) post, Justin Sun emphasized the importance of recognizing the crypto community, companies, and protocols as significant stakeholders.\n\t“We need to demonstrate to the candidate that the cryptocurrency community, companies, and protocols are significant stakeholders whose voices should be heard and whose interests should be protected,” he wrote.\n\tSun’s statement came after former US President Donald Trump expressed his support for the crypto industry, particularly regarding self-custody in digital assets. Although Sun did not explicitly name any candidates, the crypto community speculated about potential pro-crypto endorsements.\n\tRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\tLast weekend, Trump made headlines with a bold promise that the future of Bitcoin and crypto would be shaped in the USA, not overseas. He also vowed never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\tThis declaration received widespread support from the crypto community. Prominent figures like Anthony ‘Pomp’ Pompliano, an investor at Pomp Investment, praised Trump’s stance.\n\t“This is surreal. The leading Presidential candidate is explicitly saying he will make America the leader in Bitcoin and crypto, while supporting the right to self-custody. All the critics were wrong. The government won’t ban it, they’re embracing it,” Pomp said.\n\tOther influential figures in the crypto industry have previously called for supporting pro-crypto candidates in the presidential election. BeInCrypto reported that Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, emphasized the importance of voting for crypto-friendly candidates in the upcoming elections.\n\tHoskinson also critiqued President Joe Biden’s stringent stance on crypto. He called the idea of regulating crypto under the Securities Act of 1933 “an absurd statement.”\n\tBillionaire investor Mark Cuban, known for his advocacy for this industry, voiced concerns with the current administration’s approach to crypto. He criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s stringent policies, which impede legitimate crypto ventures and harm many businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\tInstitutional support for pro-crypto candidates is also growing. Earlier this month, crypto exchange Coinbase created a new political action committee (PAC) called “Stand With Crypto.”\n\tThis PAC aims to support political candidates who favor crypto financially. They plan to utilize contributions from over 450,000 members to back a bipartisan group of candidates in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\tIndeed, crypto has emerged as a major issue in this year’s election.

    "title": "Exploring Tether: Why USDT Dominates Today’s Crypto Market",
    "time": "2024-05-23",
    "author": "Ali M.",
    "content": "\tStablecoins have become an essential part of the blockchain space, offering stability in a highly volatile market. Although there are dozens of stablecoins with different collateral available to investors today, Tether’s USDT remains the to-go choice for most crypto users.\n\tIn this article, we explore the importance of stablecoins, focusing on USDT and its unconditional dominance.\n\tStablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, euro, or even commodities like gold. They achieve this stability through various mechanisms, including fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, and algorithmic stablecoins. Fiat-collateralized stablecoins, the most common type, back each token issued with reserves of the corresponding fiat currency, ensuring support by a real-world asset.\n\tWhile many crypto investors enjoy a bit of volatility, the level seen in most crypto assets can make it difficult to use them for payments or trading. Stablecoins address this issue by offering a stable and reliable alternative, facilitating their use in a wide range of applications, including base trading pairs, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\tThis has resulted in substantial growth for stablecoins, now boasting a combined market capitalization of $161 billion. The chart below highlights this significant increase, which began in 2020.\n\tRead more: How to Buy USDT in Three Easy Steps – A Beginner’s Guide\n\t“While some of this growth is due to the rising interest in cryptocurrencies, it is primarily driven by the growing importance of DeFi and the crucial role stablecoins play in DeFi primitives like lending protocols and automated market makers (AMMs),” Vincent Maliepaard, Marketing Director at IntoTheBlock, told BeInCrypto.\n\tDespite strong competition, Tether (USDT) has established itself as the most important stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. Launched in 2014, USDT is pegged to the US dollar, with each token purportedly backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency held in reserve.\n\tData from IntoTheBlock shows that USDT, with a market cap of $111 billion, accounts for just over 70% of the total stablecoin market capitalization. In contrast, the second largest stablecoin, USDC, accounts for just 21%.\n\tRead more: 9 Best Crypto Wallets to Store Tether (USDT)\n\tFurthermore, there is no sign that this growth is slowing down soon. The number of USDT transactions has significantly increased since the start of the year and is approaching new highs.\n\tMaliepaard notes USDT’s dominance is attributed to several factors:\n\tWhile USDT activity is booming across all chains, not all are created equal. Data suggests that users utilize stablecoins differently across various networks. By examining their behavior on different chains, we can see how USDT is utilized in diverse ways. Whether it’s for trading, transferring value, or acting as a stable store of value, USDT’s versatility is evident.\n\tTRON leads in transaction volume with a dominant 78% share. The chart below highlights its superiority compared to other blockchain networks.\n\tThis prominence is primarily due to TRON’s low transaction costs and high availability for deposits and withdrawals on major centralized exchanges, making it the preferred option for cross-border Tether’s USDT transactions. Surprisingly, the runner-up isn’t Ethereum but Polygon, which has over 8% of the total USDT transactions.\n\tExamining the stablecoin’s volume market share reveals that Ethereum’s transaction volume far exceeds its number of transactions, highlighting its role in facilitating higher-value transfers. In contrast, chains like Polygon, Optimism, and Avalanche have a higher number of transactions but contribute less to the overall volume, indicating their use for smaller, more frequent transactions.\n\tThe average holding time of USDT on each chain further supports this finding. Data shows that Ethereum users typically keep USDT for 228 days, nearly three times longer than holders on Optimism. TRON addresses also maintain USDT for an extended period, averaging 183 days.\n\tThese insights indicate that on Ethereum and TRON, USDT is primarily held to mitigate market volatility, serving as a stable store of value. Conversely, on chains like Optimism and Arbitrum, USDT is frequently used for transactions, likely in DeFi-related applications where quick access to liquidity and transfer speed are crucial.\n\tStablecoins, particularly USDT, play a vital role in the blockchain industry by providing stability and enhancing the utility of digital assets. The recent growth of USDT across various blockchain networks solidifies its position in the cryptocurrency market. As the industry widens, the importance of stablecoins will likely grow, driven by their role in DeFi, trading, and bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tThe XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized public blockchain supporting the XRP cryptocurrency, has achieved a significant milestone, surpassing 88 million ledgers.\n\tThis achievement highlights the platform’s continuous growth and success in the cryptocurrency market.\n\tIn the XRP Ledger ecosystem, the term “ledger” has a unique meaning. Unlike a personal financial ledger, the XRP Ledger is a decentralized, digital record of all XRP transactions. When a user sends XRP to someone, the validators confirm and validate the transaction. This agreement occurs every few seconds in what are known as “ledgers.”\n\tXRP Ledger Services shows a ledger count of 88,165,021, with 5,199,695 accounts. These accounts, excluding a few in 2022 with zero balances, hold 60,278,958,763 XRP.\n\tRipple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report reveals significant developments. Blockchain recorded 251.39 million on-chain transactions, a 108% increase from Q4 2023. Additionally, the average transaction cost dropped by 45% to $0.000856.\n\tRead more: Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tHowever, all these achievements had almost no effect on XRP price. Unlike many altcoins that have achieved new all-time highs in 2024, the token’s dynamics remain modest.\n\tTrading volume remained steady across major cryptocurrency exchanges, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit handling over 70% of the total volume. The volume traded via fiat pairs dropped from 15% in Q4 to 11% in Q1. Most XRP trading now occurs against USDT.\n\tThe continuing legal dispute between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a critical challenge for both the company and XRP holders. On March 22, the SEC filed a request in court seeking roughly $2 billion in remedies against Ripple for institutional XRP sales. Ripple responded on April 22, arguing that a penalty of no more than $10 million was justified in this case.\n\tThe company argues that the law doesn’t permit the SEC to require disgorgement or interest without proving harm, showcasing resilience and determination in the legal battle.\n\t“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” Ripple noted.\n\tRead more: Everything You Need To Know About Ripple vs SEC\n\tYesterday, the FIT21 bill passed, raising questions about XRP’s future. Ripple holds 46.5% of the 100 billion XRP supply, with 5,258,162,324 XRP currently in their possession. Additionally, 41.3 billion XRP, currently locked, will be subject to escrow. The bill defines decentralization as no single entity controlling the blockchain and no related parties holding more than 20% of the cryptocurrency or voting power. The law clarifies that crypto is regulated by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC, which might impact the ongoing lawsuits.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tLondon’s Southwark Crown Court sentenced Jian Wen, a former fast food worker, to six years and eight months in prison. The court convicted her of laundering about 150 Bitcoin (BTC) linked to a broader $5.6 billion fraud in China.\n\tThis case highlights a major breakthrough in the fight against crypto-related crimes.\n\tWen, 42, transitioned from living in the modest basement of an East London Chinese takeaway to owning a luxurious six-bedroom mansion. She consistently denied her involvement, claiming she was merely following orders from Yadi Zhang, alleged to be the architect of the scheme.\n\tThe scheme transferred large sums of stolen money from China, then converted them into Bitcoin and laundered them through various assets across the UK, Europe, and Dubai. Influenced by an extensive array of digital evidence, including thousands of WhatsApp messages between Wen and Zhang, the jury convicted Wen after a nearly two-month trial.\n\tRead more: 15 Most Common Crypto Scams To Look Out For\n\tWen’s transformation, marked by her high-profile shopping sprees at luxury stores, illustrates her dramatic lifestyle change. She funded this lifestyle with the proceeds from the laundered Bitcoin, which totaled over 61,000 BTC at the time of seizure, now valued at over $4 billion.\n\tDuring the sentencing, Judge Sally-Ann Hales emphasized the sophisticated and well-orchestrated nature of the crime.\n\t“I am in no doubt that you knew what you were dealing with,” the Judge said.\n\tNonetheless, Wen’s defense portrayed her as a victim manipulated by Zhang. She believed Zhang was a legitimate jewelry, Bitcoin, and property businesswoman.\n\tThis case forms part of a wider crackdown on crypto laundering. For example, the United States recently convicted Roman Sterlingov, founder of the crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog, for similar offenses.\n\tHe faces up to 20 years in prison. His operation, which obscured the origins of illicitly obtained Bitcoin, handled transactions worth nearly $400 million, mainly for darknet markets.\n\tRead more: 4 Best Bitcoin Mixers and Tumblers in 2024\n\tAuthorities have increased their scrutiny of crypto, making the crackdown a component of a global initiative to regulate it.

The JENNER token’s announcement came amid a wave of similar hacks affecting other crypto influencers and celebrities, adding to the skepticism.\n\tJenner’s X and Instagram accounts featured videos of her promoting the JENNER token. These were accompanied by statements from her manager, Sophia Hutchins, who assured followers that the project was legitimate and not a scam.\n\tHutchins emphasized her role in overseeing the project, insisting that Jenner’s accounts were secure and not compromised by hackers. Despite these reassurances, skepticism persisted within the crypto community.\n\t“A lot has been going on today, and yes this crypto on my account is real. If you wanna get in on this, get in in a hurry. Get in right now,” she said.\n\tRead more: Crypto Social Media Scams: How to Stay Safe\n\tThe concerns prompted the crypto community to invite Jenner to a Twitter Space discussion, but she could not attend. Instead, Hutchins spoke on her behalf. However, she failed to provide clear answers about the token’s value proposition.\n\tFollowing the discussion, the community has mixed reactions. Some members remained optimistic, while others suspected a coordinated scam.\n\tFurther doubt arose when it was discovered that the wallet address associated with Jenner’s token was previously linked to another hacked account belonging to adult content creator Kazumi, who promoted a different token, ZUMI, just days earlier. Meanwhile, some speculated that scammers used deepfake technology to impersonate Jenner in promotional videos.\n\tThe JENNER token debuted on pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for meme coins. Pump.fun’s official X account also actively promoted the JENNER token, further blurring the lines between a genuine launch and potential fraud.\n\tDespite these concerns, the token experienced a dramatic price increase of 28,000% in just one day. DEX Screener data reveals that JENNER has achieved a market capitalization of $18 million.\n\tThe concern is valid, as malicious actors often exploit the fame of celebrities for illegal activities, particularly with meme coins that have no practical use. Recently, prominent crypto investor Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth (GCR) confirmed their X account was hacked.\n\tThe hacked account posted about ORDI and LUNA2 on May 26.

This could be their attempt to sell their holdings to secure profits or offset losses.\n\tRegardless, the altcoin could face a bearish impact on this development.\n\tFurthermore, XRP holders’ total participation has also come down considerably. The total number of investors conducting a transaction on the network started declining in December 2023.\n\tThis decline has continued to date, which is a negative sign for the cryptocurrency.\n\tRead More: How To Buy XRP and Everything You Need To Know\n\tThe decline in active addresses shows that participation is down, which is a bearish development for the XRP price.\n\tXRP price trading at $0.53, managed to secure the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level as support. This level is also known as the bear market support floor and staying above it during bearish market conditions prevents excessive drawdowns.\n\tThis level marked at $0.51 is the likely target for the altcoin. The aforementioned factors, should they initiate a decline, could bring XRP price down to this price point. Losing it would also mean losing the support of the uptrend line sending the altcoin to $0.50 or lower.\n\tRead More: Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tHowever, if the broader market cues remain in favor of gradual uptrend, XRP price could prevent a drawdown and continue rising.

Its recent uptrend began on May 19 and has since increased 45%.\n\tETH’s futures open interest measures the total number of the coin’s futures contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. When it rises in this manner, it indicates an increase in market participants entering new positions.\n\tAssessed on a year-to-date, ETH’s open interest has grown by 69%.\n\tIn addition, the rise in ETH’s futures open interest is accompanied by a positive funding rate. As of this writing, ETH’s funding rate was 0.014%.\n\tThe funding rate refers to the periodic payment made between traders in an asset’s futures market to ensure its contract price stays close to the spot price.\n\tWhen the funding rate is positive, traders who hold long positions pay those with short positions. This usually occurs when the futures price is higher than the spot price. Indicating a higher demand for buying than selling.\n\tRead more: 9 Best Places To Stake Ethereum in 2024\n\tThe combined reading of ETH’s rising open interest and positive funding rate suggests significant bullish activity in the coin’s futures market.

With a value of 71.21, the momentum indicator signaled that market participants prefer to accumulate more ETH rather than sell their coins.\n\tFurther, the coin’s Chaikin Money (CMF), which tracks the flow of liquidity into and out of ETH’s market, rested above its center zero line at 0.22.\n\tA CMF above zero indicates market strength, suggesting high capital inflow.\n\tIf the inflow of “new money” into the ETH market continues to rise, the coin may leave the $3790 level behind it to trade at $3838.\n\tRead More: Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tHowever, if profit-taking activity ensues and the bears re-emerge, ETH’s price might drop to $3633.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tIn this analysis, we delve into Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent price action, examining key technical indicators and market signals across daily and four-hour timeframes.\n\tOur focus includes the role of the Ichimoku cloud, the significance of the Tenkan-sen plateaus, and recent trends in exchange depositing addresses to provide a comprehensive outlook for SHIB.\n\tLet’s delve into Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‘s price action on the daily and four-hour timeframes. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002393. Notably, the price has failed to enter the daily Ichimoku cloud on the upside, which is a major support level.\n\tThe price is now approaching a mid-term support level, represented by the red Tenkan-sen plateau on the chart. The 100 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily timeframe serves as a crucial mid-term support level for SHIB’s price.\n\tThe Tenkan-sen, or conversion line, is a key part of the Ichimoku system in technical analysis. It shows the average of the highest and lowest prices over the past nine periods, giving a short-term view of price trends.\n\tRead More: How To Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tZooming into the four-hour timeframe, we see a similar pattern. The price attempts to break below the Ichimoku cloud, which could accelerate the downward movement. If it tests this level, the lower boundary of the cloud will act as a critical support level to watch.\n\tAdditionally, the price has broken below the 100 EMA in the four-hour timeframe, which is also a bearish signal.\n\tThese combined signals highlight the importance of this zone as a resistance area. A break above this zone could trigger a substantial upward movement of 10% to 20%. Conversely, if the price remains below the 4H 100EMA, it could indicate a bearish continuation, potentially driving the price down to $0.00002000.\n\tThe SHIB/BTC chart also exhibits bearish signals for Shiba Inu.\n\tSHIB/BTC has tested the lower boundary on the daily timeframe and is now attempting to break below the 100 EMA, signaling a highly bearish outlook for SHIB.\n\tIf SHIB enters the cloud to the upside and Bitcoin’s price appreciates to $70,000, SHIB could potentially break above the $0.0000265 price range. However, if these conditions are not met, the bearish outlook for SHIB may persist.\n\tThe chart shows a significant spike in the number of exchange depositing addresses at the end of May. This sudden increase suggests that many SHIB holders transfer their tokens to exchanges.\n\tPotential Selling Pressure: Historically, increasing depositing addresses often precedes a sell-off. When holders move their tokens to exchanges, they typically liquidate their positions, creating selling pressure in the market.\n\tRead More: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tBearish Implications: The recent spike indicates that more SHIB holders might be preparing to sell their assets. This influx of sell orders can increase supply on exchanges, potentially driving the price down if the demand does not match the supply.\n\tOutlook: Bearish to Neutral\n\tThe current price action suggests a bearish trend, especially with the price attempting to break below the Ichimoku cloud in the four-hour timeframe.\n\tThe recent break below the 4H 100 EMA on the four-hour chart reinforces the bearish outlook. Monitor for further declines if the price fails to hold above key support levels, particularly the lower boundary of the 4H Ichimoku cloud.\n\tThe bearish outlook could be invalidated if SHIB manages to reenter the daily Ichimoku cloud. A key level to watch is the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku cloud at $0.000265. A break above this level could shift the outlook to neutral or even bullish.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

In five days, BONK’s open interest dropped by 20% from $13.8 million to $11.1 million.\n\tThis $2.7 million decline shows investors are not keen on trading BONK, a bearish sign for the altcoin.\n\tHowever, investors still hope for a rally despite money being pulled out of the Futures market.

These ETPs are designed exclusively for professional investors and carry a management expense ratio of 0.35%, making it one of the lowest fee levels for institutional-grade Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs in Europe.\n\tThe FCA’s recent policy adjustment, which relaxed restrictions on crypto products imposed after a 2020 ban, has paved the way for this development. In March 2024, the regulator announced it would allow financial institutions to list ETPs for professional investors. However, it still restricts these products for retail investors, maintaining a cautious stance on wider cryptocurrency market exposure.\n\tAlexis Marinof, WisdomTree’s Head of Europe, highlighted that UK investors previously relied on overseas exchanges for such assets. The recent move offers a more convenient local option and represents a significant step forward for the industry and UK-based professional investors seeking exposure to the asset class. Nevertheless, the FCA’s decision to restrict access to instruments has provoked controversial reactions.\n\tRead more: How To Trade a Bitcoin ETF: A Step-by-Step Approach\n\t“UK institutions have had access to BTC and ETH for some time now. ETPs/ETFs can be a good tool to broaden access to new assets but by limiting them to professional investors, the FCA has missed an opportunity and departed from what even the careful US regulators have done,” Nicolas Streschinsky, Trilitech Head of DeFi, told BeInCrypto.\n\tWisdomTree isn’t the only company to get a green light from FCA. Emily Nicolle from Bloomberg reported that 21Shares and Invesco also had their ETP prospectuses endorsed by the regulator today.\n\tWisdomTree’s ETPs are physically backed, directly holding the underlying assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. This structure provides a transparent, secure investment vehicle distinct from leveraged or derivative-based products.\n\tCurrently, 188 Crypto ETPs manage a total of $12,705.34 million in assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum account for over 73% of the total Assets Under Management (AUM) in the current ETP market. The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP ranks second in the top 10 Crypto ETPs by net flows over the last 30 days, following the 21Shares Bitcoin Core ETP.\n\tWisdomTree’s pioneering efforts in crypto ETPs began with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP in 2019.

In the last month, the altcoin has shed almost 10% of its value. In fact, during that period, ADA cratered to a low of $0.42 before rebounding.\n\tDue to a steady decline in the coin’s value in the past few weeks, most of its holders have booked losses on their transactions. An assessment of the ratio of ADA’s daily transaction volume in profit to loss (observed using a 30-day moving average) was 0.94 at press time.\n\tThis means that for every ADA transaction that ended in a loss, only 0.94 transactions returned a profit.\n\tWhen this metric returns a value below 1, it suggests a tendency for more selling pressure than buying pressure during the period under review.\n\tAs the coin’s price plunges, many of its holders continue to sit on unrealized losses. As of this writing, 2.62 million addresses, which make up 59% of all ADA holders, are “out of the money.”\n\tAn address is considered out of the money if the current market price of an asset is lower than the average cost at which the address purchased (or received) the tokens it currently holds.\n\tRead more: Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tConversely, 1.64 million addresses, representing 37% of all ADA holders, hold their coins at a profit.\n\tReadings from ADA’s Elder-Ray Index suggested that ADA investments may continue to lose their value in the short term.\n\tThis indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.

As of this writing, the value of ADA’s Elder-Ray Index was -0.038.\n\tAlso the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in a downtrend at 41.94. At this value, ADA’s RSI signaled that its selling pressure exceeded its buying activity.\n\tIf coin sell-offs continue, ADA may fall under its support at $0.42 to exchange hands at $0.416.\n\tHowever, if market participants heed ADA’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio, which currently flashes a buy signal, and “buy the dip,” the coin’s price might rally toward $0.479.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "author": "Shota Oba",
    "content": "\tBloomberg reported that federal prosecutors have recommended a five- to seven-year prison sentence for former FTX executive Ryan Salame, emphasizing his significant role in the exchange’s collapse.\n\tThe downfall of one of the largest US crypto exchanges in November 2022 continues to impact the industry.\n\tSalame pleaded guilty last September and is scheduled for sentencing on May 28. His charges include campaign finance violations and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Prosecutors argue a substantial sentence is necessary for justice and deterrence. In their memo, they highlight Salame’s offenses.\n\t“The campaign finance offense is one of the largest ever in American history. The unlicensed money-transmitting business exchanged more than $1 billion without proper supervision,” prosecutors stated.\n\tSalame’s legal team advocates for a lighter sentence of no more than 18 months. They argue he was not the mastermind and lost much of his fortune with the FTX collapse. His lawyers highlight his cooperation with authorities, including alerting the Bahamas about potential fraud.\n\tRead more: FTX Collapse Explained: How Sam Bankman-Fried’s Empire Fell\n\tSalame joined Alameda Research, FTX’s sister hedge fund, in 2019 after meeting co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried. By 2021, he moved to the Bahamas and became CEO of FTX’s subsidiary there. In addition to the unlicensed money-transmitting charges, they accuse him of acting as a straw donor for Bankman-Fried, channeling millions in political donations.\n\tFormer FTX executive agreed to forfeit nearly $6 million in assets, including a restaurant in Massachusetts, as part of his plea deal. The sentencing memo includes 28 letters from friends and family attesting to his character and highlighting his charitable contributions.\n\tSome prominent figures have pointed out the controversial nature of the court’s decision. Cal Evans, founder of Fortune Wallet and an industry veteran, discussed Salame’s case with BeInCrypto, sparking a critical debate about fairness and consistency in financial regulation.\n\t“We have to juxtapose this situation to the crisis of 2008, where whole banks collapsed and no banking “professionals” went to jail. It would be telling if both SBF and Salame are given hard jail time when nobody faced any consequences in the banking industry for equally if not worse banking practices. FTX attempted to be as regulated as possible. However as is typical with the US regulatory frameworks at the moment, there is no “clear” way that a company can be clean with their business activities. This, twinned with how Salame is being treated, is telling that the US has no intention on taking crypto seriously”, he said.\n\tSalame’s case marks the beginning of sentencing for key figures in the FTX scandal. Other prominent individuals like Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, await judgment. The November 2022 scandal revealed massive embezzlement and misappropriation of customer funds totaling $10 billion.\n\tIn March, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years for fraud.

When their value is positive, they suggest a strong demand for long positions.\n\tThe rise in an asset’s futures open interest, alongside a positive funding rate, signals an increased demand for long positions.\n\tWhile SHIB’s futures traders are opening positions in favor of a rally, readings from its price charts hint at the possibility of a short-term decline.\n\tFirstly, the dots of its Parabolic SAR indicator were atop its price at price time. They have been positioned this way since April 3.\n\tThe indicator gauges an asset’s price direction and potential trend reversals. When its dots appear above the asset’s price, it signals that the current trend is downward and may continue if sentiment fails to improve.\n\tAlso, the coin’s Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below its 50 neutral zone at press time. 44.62 SHIB’s MFI showed that selling pressure exceeded accumulation amongst its traders.\n\tThis indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset over a specific period. Its values range between 0 and 100. A reading below 50 suggests that, on average, there has been more downward price movement accompanied by higher trading volume than upward price movement.\n\tIf this trend continues, the coin’s price may fall from the $0.000026 region and settle at $0.000024.\n\tHowever, if this is invalidated, SHIB’s value is expected to rise to $0.00003.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tCoinbase leveraged current political movements in the US Congress to bolster its interlocutory appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\tIn a May 24 court filing, Coinbase argued that the SEC tried to “side-step” the Howey test, which is a legal framework used to determine assets that qualify as securities. Over the years, the crypto industry and the SEC have battled over applying this standard to digital assets.\n\tPaul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, explained the exchange’s position. According to him, the core question was whether the SEC can regulate cryptocurrency transactions as “investment contracts” when no contractual obligations exist.\n\tGrewal noted the SEC’s inconsistency and highlighted its similar appeal in the Ripple case. He stressed the importance of this unresolved legal issue for the crypto industry. The executive also contended that the SEC has an extensive history of being uncooperative with industry leaders.\n\t“From the beginning, we came to the SEC with good-faith efforts to have a conversation about a workable and balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the US. Instead, we – like much of the industry – have been met with slammed doors, changing positions, and litigation,” Grewal said.\n\tRemarkably, Coinbase also pointed out recent legislative developments that could impact the SEC’s jurisdiction on the emerging industry. During the past week, the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which could shift more regulatory power to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\tThis bill, staunchly opposed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, aims to oversee the crypto markets and enjoys strong support from industry stakeholders.\n\t“Legislators’ disagreement with the SEC’s position meanwhile has deepened: just this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved on a bipartisan basis comprehensive digital asset legislation that would deny the SEC the expansive jurisdiction it claims,” Coinbase wrote.\n\tRead More: Coinbase Review 2024: The Best Crypto Exchange for Beginners?\n\tGrewal highlighted this development as a positive shift in the political landscape and a step toward better regulatory oversight. He also reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to obtaining clarity for the industry and resisting overreach by regulators.\n\t“Earlier this week, the House recognized the need for clear rules, and we’re seeking clarity in the Courts as well. But regardless of the timeline, we’re committed to seeing this through â€“ no matter how long it takes to get clarity for the entire industry and push back against overzealous regulators. It’s what the 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve,” Grewal remarked.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tThe newly approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could trigger a supply crunch for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\tEthereum’s supply on centralized exchanges has hit an eight-year low, with only 12.78 million ETH available. This amount constitutes roughly 11% of the total supply.\n\tAnalysts have noted that investors are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges just as the asset is poised to experience a surge in institutional demand. Such a decline in exchange balances is usually a bullish sign. It indicates that investors expect price growth and have no plans to sell their holdings in the short term.\n\tThis week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved several Ethereum ETFs, which many believe could boost demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\tMara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, points to the significant institutional interest generated by spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January. These ETFs now hold 800,000 BTC, demonstrating a growing institutional appetite. Consequently, she predicts Ethereum could see similar demand, potentially leading to a significant demand shock.\n\t“What happens if there is $20 billion taken out of the market? It could be a tipping point in terms of supply and demand. We haven’t really seen this kind of rapid demand shock in the market before,” Schmiedt said.\n\tRead more: How to Invest in Ethereum ETFs?\n\tNotably, ETH is already experiencing a surge in institutional activity. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock reported that anticipation around Ethereum ETF approval pushed the on-chain trading volume to a two-year high of $15.98 billion, largely driven by crypto whales.\n\tOf the $15.98 billion, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This accounts for 90% of the total traded volume on that day.\n\tIntoTheBlock explained that the approval of ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance. It continued that this move would likely increase ETH whales’ activity, as seen in recent large-volume transactions.\n\t“The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum. This trend is poised to gain momentum, potentially leading to even greater market movements,” IntoTheBlock added.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) simplify the process for investors, potentially leading to a significant increase in Bitcoin’s price.\n\tThe Motley Fool analysts highlight that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major step in cryptocurrency acceptance. They believe this could drive Bitcoin’s price to $400,000 or even $1 million.\n\tThe ETFs allow retail investors to bypass complex crypto exchanges and digital wallets, making Bitcoin more accessible.\n\tHowever, the potential for substantial growth lies with institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market. These include pension funds, retirement plans, and hedge funds, which manage vast sums of money. Previously deterred by the complexities of digital assets, these institutions can now incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios with ease, thanks to ETFs.\n\tRead more: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tAs of now, about 700 professional investment firms have invested around $5 billion in these ETFs. Leading investors include Millennium Management, which has allocated about 3% of its $64 billion portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs. Others, such as Morgan Stanley and Bracebridge Capital, along with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, are also significant participants.\n\tDespite this growth, institutional investors still represent only about 10% of the total ETF ownership. This figure is increasing, indicating a rising institutional interest that could significantly boost demand for Bitcoin. Institutional investors often conduct extensive due diligence before diversifying into new assets like Bitcoin.\n\t“Yet, after conducting their research, I think they will all likely arrive at the same conclusion: Bitcoin’s inherent characteristics make it a necessity in portfolios. Eventually, widespread adoption among institutional investors will occur, leading to a tsunami of capital flowing in,” a Motley Fool analyst said.\n\tThis shift in investment isn’t just about increasing Bitcoin ownership; it involves strategic financial planning. With the vast sums managed by these institutions, even a small allocation to Bitcoin could have a major impact. If institutions allocate 5% of the $129 trillion assets they manage to Bitcoin, its market cap could exceed $7 trillion, pushing its price beyond $400,000.\n\tSome analysts believe a 5% allocation might be too conservative.

Staking involves committing crypto holdings to support network operations, in return earning holders a potential yield.

This initiative was marked last year by the establishment of a dedicated regulatory regime.\n\tDespite these innovations, spot-crypto ETFs in Hong Kong have encountered tepid demand since their debut in April. According to data from SoSoValue, the total net assets of all Hong Kong spot Ethereum ETFs currently stand at approximately $50 million.\n\tHowever, the potential introduction of staking options could enhance the attractiveness of these ETFs compared to direct crypto purchases on exchanges.\n\tContrastingly, in the United States, financial giants like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Ark Investment Management have recently retreated from including staking features in their proposed Ethereum ETFs. Aimed at facilitating smoother regulatory approvals, these decisions could render the ETFs less appealing compared to other investment avenues offering higher yields through active crypto staking.\n\tRead more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works\n\tMoreover, Hong Kong’s ambition to establish itself as a crypto hub extends beyond ETFs.

This marks ten consecutive days of inflows. On the same day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) received inflows of $182 million and $44 million, respectively.\n\tMeanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) received no flows on the same day.

BeInCrypto reported that Ethereum and some tokens in its ecosystem have shown impressive performance since Monday.\n\tHowever, it is important to note that the spot Ethereum ETFs have yet to be officially launched, and SEC approval for the S-1 filings is awaiting. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects that the spot Ethereum ETFs will ” take a couple of weeks but could take longer” to trade in the market.\n\t“Typically, this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples, but Eric Balchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon,” he explained.\n\tNonetheless, experts remain optimistic. Another ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts that spot Ethereum ETFs could acquire “10% to 15% of the assets of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.”\n\tDespite renewed interest in the US market, spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong saw a relatively muted performance. Data shows that from May 20 to May 23, Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded no flows for two consecutive days.

    "content": "\tFollowing Ethereum’s (ETH) recent ETF approval, the price has seen a steady incline. Is there more room for growth?\n\tBeInCrypto looks at how institutional interest and key market trends are shaping a bright future for ETH.\n\tEthereum (ETH) currently trades at $3,902, demonstrating robust bullish momentum. The price is well above the Ichimoku cloud and the 100-day EMA (currently at $3,175), indicating sustained upward pressure.\n\tSupport levels are established at $3,575 and $3,400, while resistance levels are identified at $4,134 and $4,390. The formation of higher highs and higher lows confirms the bullish pattern.\n\tIncreased trading volumes during price surges reflect strong buying interest, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.\n\tThe percentage of Ethereum held on exchanges has decreased dramatically to below 11% by May 2024. This trend indicates a significant shift towards long-term storage and staking, reducing the immediate supply available for trading and selling pressure.\n\tFollowing the news of the SEC approving the spot ETFs for Ethereum, there was a noticeable increase in outflows. This regulatory approval has likely bolstered investor confidence, leading to significant ETH withdrawals from exchanges to private storage.\n\tThe approval of spot ETFs generally implies an increased legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of the asset, encouraging investors to hold onto their Ethereum in anticipation of higher future prices.\n\tAs more ETH is moved off exchanges, the circulating supply on these platforms diminishes. With less ETH available for trading, the potential for supply shortages increases. A reduced supply on exchanges can lead to upward price pressure. When demand remains constant or increases while supply diminishes, prices are likely to rise. This scenario is conducive to a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\tThe behavior of moving Ethereum off exchanges into private wallets is a strong indicator of long-term investor confidence. This action reflects a positive sentiment towards ETH’s future value, particularly reinforced by the SEC’s approval of spot ETFs. It contributes to a bullish outlook as the overall market perceives the reduced supply and increased holding as signals of potential price appreciation.\n\tThe number of addresses holding at least $1 Million in Ethereum has steadily increased. This trend indicates growing confidence among large holders and institutional investors, suggesting long-term stability and positive market sentiment.\n\tThe increasing number of addresses holding at least $1 Million in ETH strongly indicates that institutional investors are actively buying Ethereum. This trend is driven by the growing confidence among these large holders in Ethereum’s future prospects. The SEC’s approval of spot ETFs has likely played a significant role in this development, providing a regulated and attractive investment vehicle for institutions.\n\tInstitutional investors’ entry into the Ethereum market brings a level of credibility and stability. These entities are known for their rigorous investment strategies and long-term commitments. Their participation suggests a positive outlook for Ethereum, both in terms of price appreciation and its role in the broader financial ecosystem.\n\tFinally, as more institutional investors accumulate ETH, the market will likely see reduced volatility and increased support for higher price levels. This growing institutional interest also fosters innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\tBullish Outlook: As more institutional investors accumulate ETH, the market will likely see reduced volatility and increased support for higher price levels. This growing institutional interest also fosters innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Kenya’s energy grid is approximately 80% renewable, leveraging wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, with geothermal energy being the largest contributor.\n\tFurthermore, the initiative is expected to kickstart Marathon’s mining operations in Kenya, marking a significant step in its global expansion. Crypto environmentalist Daniel Batten praised the partnership, suggesting it points to the future of Bitcoin mining.\n\t“Bitcoin mining’s future entails the development of more renewable energy that otherwise would have been unprofitable to monetize (geothermal in Kenya’s case).

Today tens of millions of people across Africa use M-PESA for branchless money transfers,” Thiel stated.\n\tThe initiative comes amid rising energy costs and increasing network mining difficulty.

    "content": "\tInstitutional investor BlockTower Capital has reportedly sold its entire bag of Pepe (PEPE) tokens from a wallet tracked by the on-chain analysis platform Spot On Chain. The sale totals approximately $2.79 million.\n\tThis significant divestment coincided with Pepe reaching new price peaks, allowing BlockTower Capital to capture substantial profits.\n\tThe transaction involved transferring 202.22 billion PEPE tokens to the crypto trading firm Cumberland at a rate of $0.00001381 each. Importantly, this sale follows a recent acquisition of the same tokens from Cumberland for $0.000011 per token, totaling around $2.22 million on May 15, 2024.\n\tConsequently, BlockTower Capital garnered an estimated profit of $569,000, reflecting a 25.6% return in just seven days.\n\t“Currently, BlockTower Capital no longer holds any PEPE,” Spot On Chain claims.\n\tFurthermore, other early investors of PEPE are also capitalizing on the token’s recent surge.

This week, the meme coin has appreciated by over 45%.\n\tThis rally is largely fueled by speculation regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.

    "content": "\tEvery May 22, the crypto community celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day. This historic event occurred in 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a Bitcoin developer, paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas through the Bitcointalk forum.\n\tThis transaction went almost unnoticed at the time. However, today, it is legendary, reflecting both the evolution of cryptocurrencies and their transformative potential.\n\tBack then, Bitcoin was an emerging technology known to only a handful of enthusiasts and developers. Paying with cryptocurrencies in a conventional establishment was almost unthinkable.\n\tHanyecz’s transaction, valued at approximately $41 then, would be worth over $708 million today. However, focusing solely on the current value of those 10,000 BTC overlooks the historical importance of this milestone.\n\tRead more: Bitcoin Pizza Day Explained: The Story of the First BTC Transaction\n\tParth Chaturvedi, Head of Investments at CoinSwitch Ventures, notes that despite seeming like an unfavorable exchange in retrospect, this transaction was celebrated within the emerging crypto community as a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency’s acceptance as a legitimate asset class.\n\t“Fast forward to today, Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule has given it the moniker of ‘Digital Gold,’ and institutional giants are recommending it to their clients as an asset for portfolio diversification,” Chaturvedi told BeInCrypto.\n\tIndeed, millions of businesses and service providers nowadays accept cryptocurrencies as payment. This advance was inspired, in part, by that first pizza order.\n\tBitcoin Pizza Day is more than a curious anecdote. It is a reminder of cryptocurrencies’ potential and the rapid pace at which technology can transform the global economy.\n\tSince then, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved significantly. The creation of Ethereum in 2015, with its capacity for smart contracts, has enabled the automation of processes and the secure execution of complex transactions. Implementing new blockchains and protocols has also improved the speed and efficiency of transactions, making crypto payments more accessible and convenient for everyone.\n\tCurrent solutions, such as crypto-based debit and credit cards, will remain critical, as will the growing integration of blockchain into business models worldwide. Looking to the future, it is clear that the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies will continue.\n\tRead more: How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tAs more governments and companies recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies, the industry will continue to innovate and expand.

    "time": "2024-05-24",
    "author": "Shota Oba",
    "content": "\tRecent research reveals that the size of airdrops has a surprisingly limited impact on token price performance.\n\tDespite the common belief that larger token distributions lead to significant price movements, findings from multiple studies suggest otherwise.\n\tAirdrops, a method of distributing newly minted tokens to selected wallets, have become a common practice in cryptocurrency. They often help establish an initial float, enable on-chain governance and power transactions, reward early contributors, and attract new users. However, the actual impact of these distributions on token prices remains a topic of debate.\n\tA comprehensive study analyzing over 2 million events across 40 different protocols found that the size of token distribution does not significantly affect price performance or volatility.\n\t“Large anticipated token distribution events typically create selling pressure and stabilize lower after some time,” the study says.\n\tRead more: What are Crypto Airdrops?\n\tAnother study by CoinGecko supports this view, highlighting that 23 out of the 50 biggest token distributions recorded peak token prices during the first two weeks of their airdrop date. This immediate interest often leads to a brief surge in price, followed by stabilization as the market adjusts.\n\tThe type of recipient plays a crucial role in token price performance. Airdrops to core users already engaged with the protocol result in better price performance. These users are likelier to hold or buy more tokens, leading to lower volatility and more stable prices. Conversely, widespread airdrops to a broader audience often result in more immediate sellers.\n\t“Widespread recipients were twice as likely to sell their tokens, causing higher volatility and more significant price drops,” analysts note.\n\tRead more: Best Upcoming Airdrops in 2024\n\tThis strategic targeting helps maintain token value and reduce post-airdrop price volatility, indicating stronger community retention and engagement. For instance, small token distributions to core users resulted in 4-8 times more buyers than other categories.\n\tIn conclusion, the size of airdrops has little impact on token prices. Instead, the type of recipients and their engagement with the project significantly influence the price dynamics. These findings challenge the traditional belief that larger airdrops lead to better performance, highlighting the importance of recipient behavior.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

    "content": "\tCoinbase has announced that New York users can trade XRP again, a significant development for the cryptocurrency community.\n\tThis move follows a long suspension since January 2021 due to regulatory issues.\n\tOn January 19, 2021, Coinbase stopped the token trading because the US SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The SEC claimed Ripple sold unregistered securities worth $1.38 billion through the token sales. This caused widespread token suspensions and delistings in the US, including on Coinbase.\n\tThe initial suspension significantly impacted its market presence. Users couldn’t trade or convert their XRP to fiat currency but could still deposit, store, and transfer the token. Coinbase took this step to mitigate legal risks from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple.\n\tPaul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, shared the news on social media.\n\t“XRP trading on @coinbase is available again in NY.

As of now, XRP is priced at $0.527964, showing a minor decrease of 0.23% in the past 24 hours.\n\tDespite the positive news, XRP’s future fate is in doubt. The legal battles have created uncertainty around the project, so Ripple now faces the challenge of restoring its image to shine again.\n\t“Even though Ripple has scored some notable wins in their legal battle against the SEC, the battle itself has marred the project in insecurity and cost XRP precious time and market share. There’s a pretty good chance we’ll have total regulatory clarity pretty soon, but by now they have a lot of ground to cover and a tarnished image that will need to be rigorously polished if they’re to compete in today’s institutionally focused crypto landscape,” Mati Greenspan, founder & CEO of Quantum Economics, told BeInCrypto.\n\tRead more: Everything You Need To Know About Ripple vs SEC\n\tThe recent passage of the FIT21 bill also poses a serious threat to Ripple: the document defines decentralization as no single entity controlling the blockchain and no related parties holding more than 20% of the cryptocurrency or voting power.\n\tRipple, meanwhile, holds 46.5% of the 100 billion the token supply, with 5,258,162,324 XRP currently in their possession.

    "author": "Adam Mourad",
    "content": "\tChainlink has recently experienced a significant price increase, jumping from $13 to $17.\n\tThis analysis delves into the factors driving this impressive rise. Focusing on the spike in on-chain activity and Bitcoin’s concurrent rally.\n\tOn the daily timeframe, Chainlink has tested the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, which is currently around the $17.41 mark. This test suggests a strong resistance level. A successful break above this boundary could indicate further bullish momentum.\n\tThe Ichimoku Cloud is a tool used in technical analysis to help identify trends in the market. Here’s a simple breakdown:\n\tCloud: The shaded area on the chart shows potential support and resistance levels.\n\tWhen the price is above the cloud, it suggests an upward trend (bullish). When the price is below the cloud, it suggests a downward trend (bearish).\n\tLines: There are several lines in the Ichimoku Cloud:\n\tConversion Line (Tenkan): Shows the average price over the last 9 periods (candles).\n\tBase Line (Kijun): Shows the average price over the last 26 periods (candles).\n\tLeading Span A and B: These form the cloud and project future support and resistance levels.\n\tRead More: How To Buy Chainlink (LINK) and Everything You Need To Know\n\tChainlink has retraced to the Fibonacci levels, with significant support observed at $16.41 (0.236), $15.525 (0.382 level), and $14.09 (0.618 level). Holding above these levels, especially the $15.525 support, will maintain the bullish outlook.\n\tAdditionally, LINK/BTC on the daily timeframe has just entered the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a potential upward trajectory. The entry into the cloud is often a precursor to a price increase, suggesting that LINK could see further gains against Bitcoin.\n\tOn the 4-hour timeframe, LINK is trading above the Ichimoku cloud against Bitcoin and is currently testing its upper boundary. If LINK can maintain this position, it supports the bullish outlook. However, if LINK fails to hold above this level and breaks downward, it could change the market sentiment.\n\tThe bullish scenario becomes more favorable considering Bitcoin’s potential rise to $73,000. If Bitcoin continues its upward trend, LINK could potentially trade back at $19 in the mid-term.\n\tOverall, the technical indicators and key support/resistance levels suggest a strong bullish potential for Chainlink, provided it can hold above critical levels and capitalize on Bitcoin’s upward momentum.\n\tThe recent spike in on-chain activity for Chainlink has helped propel its price from $13 to $17. This surge in activity is evident in the sharp increase in daily active addresses, as shown in the chart.\n\tThe green line representing active addresses has notably spiked, indicating heightened network usage and engagement.\n\tRead More: Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030\n\tAdditionally, Bitcoin’s concurrent rise to $72,000 has provided a favorable macro environment for Chainlink’s price increase. The bullish momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin, has likely contributed to the positive price action observed in Chainlink.\n\tKey levels to watch are $16.41 (the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud), $15.52 (the 0.382 Fibonacci level), and $14.09 (the 0.618 Fibonacci level). These indicators can help you optimize your trading strategy.\n\tWhile LINK shows strong potential, diversify your portfolio with other high-potential assets to mitigate risk.\n\tStay informed about Chainlink’s developments and participate in community discussions to gain insights into upcoming projects.\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "content": "\tAccording to the latest annual household survey by the Federal Reserve, only 7 percent of American adults currently hold or use crypto.\n\tThis marks a decrease from previous years, with a drop of 3 percentage points from 2022 and 5 percentage points from 2021.\n\tThe Federal Reserve’s findings, derived from a comprehensive study conducted in October 2023 with 11,488 US adults, suggest a declining interest in crypto as an investment and a medium for financial transactions. Amidst broader discussions about the viability and future of digital currencies, this trend indicates a cooling of enthusiasm.\n\tBased on the US Census Bureau’s March 2023 current population survey, there are 258 million adults in the US. Hence, the calculation from this data indicates that 18 million US adults own crypto.\n\tHowever, the survey’s results starkly contrast with other industry data. For example, Statista, a data analysis company, estimates that there are approximately 74.37 million crypto users in the US. This discrepancy raises questions about the actual penetration of crypto in the American market.\n\tRead more: Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2024?\n\tFurthermore, prominent industry figures such as Michael Novogratz and Anthony Scaramucci have provided numbers that challenge the Federal Reserve’s estimates. They highlighted the popularity of crypto by comparing it to dog ownership in the country.\n\t“There are 85 million people in this country that own crypto in one form or another. There are 65 million dog owners, so you have more crypto owners than you have dog owners,” Scaramucci said.\n\tDespite these varying figures, the Federal Reserve’s report offers an in-depth look at how cryptocurrencies are utilized by those who engage with them. Significantly, only 2 percent of adults reported using crypto to make a financial transaction. Among these users, international transfers were notable, with one-fourth indicating that at least one transaction was made internationally.\n\tThe reasons for choosing cryptocurrency for transactions were diverse. Around 30 percent of users stated that their choice was driven by the recipient’s preference for crypto. Other factors included the speed of transactions and privacy concerns, while fewer cited safety or distrust in traditional banking systems as their primary motivation.\n\tIn terms of demographics, cryptocurrency use was more prevalent among younger to middle-aged adults and predominantly males, both for investment and transactional purposes.\n\tRead more: Crypto vs. Banking: Which Is a Smarter Choice?\n\tAdditionally, the report indicated that cryptocurrency usage for transactions was higher among the unbanked.
