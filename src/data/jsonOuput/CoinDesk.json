    "content": "\tLayer 1 blockchain Sui, created by the team that led Meta's Diem crypto project, climbed into the top 10 decentralized finance (DeFi) rankings Tuesday, less than a year after inception, the project said.\n\tThe total value locked (TVL) has jumped by more than 1,000% in four months, catapulting the blockchain above more established incumbents such as Bitcoin and Cardano, as well as Coinbase's layer-2, Base. The dollar value of cryptocurrencies deposited in its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols topped $430 million, making it the 10th-largest blockchain by TVL, Sui said. As of writing, it had slipped to No. 11, behind PulseChain, DeFi Llama data show.\n\t\"This momentum validates both the technology and dedication of the Sui community,” Greg Siourounis, managing director of the Sui Foundation, said in an email. \"Most importantly, what we are seeing in these numbers is developers on Sui building products that people are using to address real-world challenges. That dynamic will form the basis of a sustainable decentralized network that lasts well into the future.\"\n\tSui's mainnet went live in May 2023. It's a layer-1 blockchain, much like Ethereum or Bitcoin, but with a specific type of proof-of-stake consensus named delegated proof-of-stake. Its native token, (SUI), is used for validator and delegator staking, to pay gas fees and as a right on governance.\n\tAccording to DeFi Llama, at press time, Sui was home to 22 DeFi protocols, two of which had a TVL of over $100 million and four protocols with more than $40 million each.\n\tThe SUI price surged 109% in January, extending the two-month winning streak to hit a record-high $1.65, according to CoinDesk data.\n\tEarly this week, Sui announced integration with crypto-compatible payments infrastructure provider Banxa to add seamless and low-cost fiat on-ramps. Additionally, Mysten Labs’ Sui Wallet will facilitate the purchase of SUI tokens through Banxa’s fiat on-ramp solution and utilize off-ramp solutions.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tBlockchain-powered secondary markets can help expand the reach of tokenized assets, analysts at Moody's Investors Service said in a report published Thursday.\n\tTokenization is the representation of real-world assets on a blockchain, and financial institutions worldwide are exploring how it can improve the efficiency, cost and reach of financial markets. For example, tokenization allows large assets such as private equity or real estate to be broken down and represented by multiple tokens, opening the market to a wider range of investors, a previous report from the ratings company said.\n\tWhile financial institutions and governments have started dabbling in the issuance of tokenized assets – such as Hong Kong's $100 million green bond last year – there is a lack of secondary markets where they can be traded after the primary offering, the Moody's analysts note.\n\tThis limits the adoption of tokenization, the new report said, adding that there is a noticeable growth in blockchain-powered secondary markets.\n\tBlockchain and tokenization bring \"significant innovations to secondary market structures,\" and developing secondary markets for blockchain-based securities could improve liquidity management, enhance market data accessibility and facilitate instantaneous settlements, the report said.\n\t\"These blockchain-powered secondary markets address several perceived drawbacks of traditional secondary markets, including limited accessibility of certain asset classes, inefficiencies in settlement processes, and high operational costs,\" the report said.\n\tThough these blockchain markets promise innovation, the report warns that there are also technological and regulatory hurdles.\n\t\"The technology underpinning these markets, primarily smart contracts, is susceptible to risks such as bugs, rug pulls, price manipulations, and oracle failures. These vulnerabilities not only pose financial risks to participants but also hinder the broader acceptance and integration of [decentralized finance],\" the report said.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tThe market capitalization of programmable blockchain Solana's sol (SOL) token could exceed that of rival Ethereum's ether (ETH) during the next bullish cycle, one crypto observer said in December.\n\tThis week, the market has shown how Herculean the task would be: The ether price surged more than 19% on Monday, adding $70 billion to its market cap for a total of $439 billion, according to data source TradingView. That's a gain equivalent to almost 90% of SOL's market value in just one day.\n\tThe surge followed renewed hopes that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S. Analysts say the gap between ether and its rivals like SOL will widen in the coming months as a potential spot ETF launch open the token to mainstream institutional adoption. So far, only bitcoin has had that privilege.\n\tAt press time, ether was the world's second-largest digital asset, boasting a market cap of $453 billion, exceeded only by bitcoin's (BTC) $1.38 trillion. Sol, meanwhile, ranked fifth with a market value of $82 billion.\n\t\"Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish. Let's not overcomplicate it,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. \"The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,\"\n\tSince its inception in 2015, Ethereum has been the world's leading smart contract blockchain, powering over 4,000 decentralized applications. It's home to some of the most critical decentralized finance protocols like Uniswap, AAVE and tokenization initiatives like BlackRock's BUIDL. Moreover, Ethereum has never experienced a Solana-like outage.\n\tStill, there have been instances, particularly during bull runs, when traders shifted to Solana to bypass Ethereum's network congestion and higher transactions costs. For instance, Solana's share in global trading volume on decentralized exchanges rose early this year thanks to the meme coin frenzy. That spurred talks of SOL eventually overtaking ETH.\n\tIf the ETH ETF speculation and recent price action is anything to go by, such talks appear premature.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

The existing assets, FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH, and the new ones will be issued on Fraxtal going forward, the proposal floated by founder Sam Kazemian and other contributors added.\n\tLayer 3 protocols provide decentralized applications with a highly customizable and interoperable network built on top of layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\tKazemian also called for reviving a mechanism to share the protocol revenue with stakers of its native tokens.\n\t“We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE),” the proposal said. “FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while significantly increasing the liquidity of FXS and its paired Frax assets.”\n\tFXS is the governance and utility token of the Frax ecosystem. FXS holders who lock their tokens receive veFXS, which can be staked on the Ethereum mainnet and Fraxtal.\n\tBesides, the plan details how new tokenomics will fully collateralize Frax’s stablecoin FRAX, one of the top 10 dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in the world, and boost yields on staked FRAX (sFRAX).\n\tFXS changed hands at $1.35 at press time, representing a 2% gain on a 24-hour basis.

    "content": "\tCelestia, the modular blockchain that claims to scale with more users, has struggled to wrangle much of a market share in its first week, with less than 350,000 transactions registered in the four days following its release.\n\tData from Mintscan shows that current transactions per second (TPS) on Celestia is 0.19. This doesn't necessarily translate to a lack of technical function, but it does mean a lack of activity on the blockchain.\n\tBy comparison, Ethereum is currently recording 29.33 TPS, according to data from L2Beat. Arbitrum, another modular blockchain, has been hitting between 35 and 45 TPS on average over the past week.\n\tAround 190,000 users claimed Celestia's airdrops on Tuesday despite more than 600,000 being eligible to do so, leaving slightly less than $1 million in unclaimed value.\n\tRead more: Celestia Airdrops TIA Token as Network Goes Live, Claims Start of 'Modular Era'\n\tThe token currently trades at $2.33 with a market cap of $329 million. Daily trading volume peaked at $475 million on Wednesday. It has since dropped to around $170 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\tIt's worth noting that Celestia's business model is centered around data availability, which is designed to scale Celestia and the entire crypto ecosystem as a whole. Modular blockchains work by creating specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains.\n\tDespite a slow start in terms of activity, Celestia network validators can currently receive around 23.39% APR as a yield for staking the native TIA token, considerably higher than Ethereum's rate of 3.8%.\n\tThe performance of the TIA token has also been impressive compared to the likes of sui (SUI) and aptos (APT), both of which were airdropped to early adopters over the past year, and both endured bitter downturns after being issued. The stability of TIA can be attributed to a low level of inflation, as early investors and core developers have their token allocation locked up until October 2024.\n\tRead more: How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight\n\tEdited by Aoyon Ashraf.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "time": "2023-11-15",
    "author": "Oliver Knight",
    "content": "\tNewly-launched modular blockchain Celestia has experienced a slow start in terms of on-chain activity, but that hasn't reduced the appetite of traders who have spurred a speculative rally for its native TIA token to $6.30, 200% higher than when it debuted at around $2.10 two weeks ago.\n\tTIA's rise doesn't correlate to an uptick in blockchain usage; though the Celestia blockchain facilitated 350,000 transactions in the first two days following its launch, it has only added another 160,000 transactions since then, according to MintScan.\n\tBy comparison, rival modular blockchain Arbitrum has averaged between 550,000 and 920,000 daily transactions over the past seven days, Arbiscan data shows.\n\tAnother metric to assess the scalability of blockchains is transactions per second (TPS). Celestia is currently totaling 0.13 TPS. Arbitrum, meanwhile has a daily average of 8.01 TPS, according to L2Beat.\n\tIt's worth noting that as Celestia only rolled out a fortnight ago and adoption is not expected to match that of Arbitrum, which has been operational since May, 2021, but it is now facing competition from industry heavyweights like NEAR, which has joined the race with Celestia to provide data availability services to Ethereum rollups.\n\tData availability \"allows network nodes to download, store, and make transaction information accessible for verification,\" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStat, in a note earlier this month.\n\tDespite a lack of immediate demand for its data availability functionality, Celestia's tokenomics have caught the attention of traders. Just 141 million tokens of the 1 billion hard cap are circulating, with the majority of the total supply being locked up until October 2024 and October 2026. Trading volume for TIA is around $900 million over the past 24 hours, exceeding the market cap of all tokens in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\tThe rally can be compared to Aptos, which like Celestia issued its APT token in the form of an airdrop when it launched last year. APT rocketed to a $2.9 billion market cap after its release despite the total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain being just $50 million at the time.\n\tEdited by Nikhilesh De.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tThe number of blockchain addresses holding at least $1,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC), which equates to 0.028 BTC at the current price of $35,115, has increased to a record high of 8 million, according to data tracked by Blockware Solutions and Glassnode.\n\tPer Blockware, the above number could grow exponentially as bitcoin continues to monetize, a long-term bullish development for the cryptocurrency. Monetization, in theory, refers to the process of creating income potential from a non-revenue generating asset.\n\t“If there are 10s or 100s of millions of addresses that contain thousands of dollars worth of BTC, that’s a tremendous amount of purchasing power,” Blockware Solutions said in an email.\n\tThe record figure comes as bitcoin has gained nearly 25% in four weeks amid speculation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve one or more spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The optimism has also galvanized whale activity on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tVladimir Putin just won his fifth term as Russian president, though the 87% landslide election victory has been labeled preordained, stage-managed and a farce.\n\tNow, exiled opposition leader Mark Feygin is leading an effort to give Russians an anonymous, blockchain-powered way to register a \"protest vote\" against Putin.\n\tThe results of this effort would, of course, have no legal weight in Russia and would not end Putin's presidency per se, but the referendum could, in theory, give a public relations boost to efforts to oust him. And it gives Russians a way to voice criticism in a nation where the consequences of dissent can be high; opposition leader Alexei Navalny recently died while jailed in an Arctic penal colony.\n\tThe vote will be conducted on an app called Russia2024, built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, which will use the Arbitrum blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography, making voters' identities untraceable.\n\t“Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track,” Feygin said in a statement. He was exiled from Russia years ago, termed a foreign agent in 2022 and remains a wanted person in Russia. He is a former lawyer for the founders of the protest collective Pussy Riot. “It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” he added.\n\tOnly holders of Russian passports will be able to cast their vote. Around 34.6 million Russians have a valid passport.\n\tUsers will need to download the Russia2024 app and prove their citizenship by scanning their passports with their phones. The passports have a biometric chip that the tool uses to confirm the voter's identity and facilitate an anonymous vote. If a person doesn’t own a smartphone, a single phone can be used as a shared voting machine.\n\tVoting will be allowed for about two weeks, and the backers behind the tool are “sure” it is a secure way to vote and that voters don't need to fear repercussions.\n\t“Even after Navalny’s death, people came out and protested so they will vote as a countermeasure to the result,” said Freedom Tool co-founder Lasha Antadze, who has previously collaborated with the Ukrainian government to digitize the privatization of state properties. “Decentralized voting and the Freedom Tool is designed such that there is no single entity to attack, block or get rid of. You can’t hack it just like you can’t hack bitcoin.”\n\tAntadze also holds passports from Ukraine and Georgia. Putin’s victory is expected to give him the means to continue his war against Ukraine.\n\t“We are handing out the open-source technology to everyone. It’s not only Ukrainians or Georgians building,” Antadze said when asked about the possible perception that this is backed by Ukrainian interests. “We got a lot of contributions through anonymous letters from cryptography professors within Russia. It’s a kind of wartime defense technology.”\n\tAntadze, who spoke to CoinDesk from London, said the Russia2024 app was removed from the Apple app store initially, but they expect it to be back online this Friday. The app is available on Google's app store.\n\tReferendums have been used for different reasons across the world: for signaling dissent in Canada, to pass specific policy in Switzerland and to choose whether a region wants to stay united with a nation or not in the U.K.\n\tThe main global “real world use case” is that it “can guarantee that authenticity,” it can “cut the cost” of any election-related voting exercise by “10 times” and the technology can be used by other nations, too, Antadze said.\n\tEdited by Nick Baker.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tPolicymakers from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced nations agreed to collectively scan for early warning signs of developments that may reduce competition in digital markets, according to an announcement on Wednesday.\n\tThe communiqué came after the group's Competition Authorities and Policymakers’ Summit in Hiroshima, Japan discussed concerns arising from digital markets. The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission participated in the summit.\n\t\"In this context, G7 competition authorities and policymakers are using their enhanced skillsets to scan the horizon for early warning signs of conduct or market factors that might make markets tip or reduce contestability as well as to identify key technologies and issues that may raise competition concerns in the future,\" the communiqué said.\n\t\"Digital markets can present competition concerns,\" the statement said. \"Markets characterized by network effects, economies of scale, digital ecosystems, and accumulations of large amounts of data can be prone to increasing or creating barriers to entry, tipping, and dominance.\"\n\tNew technologies, in particular, can alter the competitive balance and lead to greater market domination by a smaller group of companies, according to the G7. The meeting concluded that it is essential for policymakers to understand emerging technologies to take swift and proportionate action to prevent harm.\n\t\"As the digital economy evolves, new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and metaverse are emerging, allowing some businesses developing or using those technologies to grow rapidly,\" the announcement said.\n\tThe meeting produced three documents – the communniqué, an inventory of new rules for digital markets prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and an analytical note meant to be read with the inventory.\n\t\"Despite differences in their regulatory models, all regimes in the Inventory share broadly similar concerns vis-à-vis certain digital firms and adopt similar approaches to identify them,\" the analytical note said.\n\tParticipants committed to share updates on legal reforms, policy advances, institutional changes, and enforcement developments to take timely enforcement and regulatory action to protect competition in digital markets.\n\tRead More: Stablecoin Regulation Is a Sticking Point Between the G7 and G20\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\t\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, a blockchain acting as an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network, is nursing moderate losses a day after Comos' founder Jae Kwon called community members to split the blockchain into two, with one observer hailing the potential hard fork as a bullish outcome for the investor community.\n\t\"Let's coordinate a split,\" Kwon said Sunday, following a decision by the Cosmos community to approve a proposal to reduce ATOM's inflation to 10% from 14%. Cosmos Hub is an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.\n\tThe so-called proposal 848, approved with 41.1% support for the reduction from the participating voting power and 31.9% against it, said that ATOM's double-digit inflation rate represented overpayment by the Hub for security and disincentivized ATOM's use in decentralized finance. The approved change is projected to bring down Atom's annualized staking yield from approximately 19% to about 13.4%. Staking refers to locking coins in a blockchain in return for rewards.\n\tKwon, however, wasn't impressed and called for the hard fork.\n\t\"Despite our voting [against the plan]… 848 has ended up passing, something that isn't too surprising (though it would be good to know whether the later votes came from newly purchased ATOMs),\" Kwon said on X.\n\tKwon referred to the hard fork as AtomOne, which would fork the Cosmos Hub, calling for a final plan whereby the forked chain would support ATOM token along with the native ATOM1.\n\t\"I believe that the final plan should include an integration of $ATOM and $ATMO/$ATOM1 so that instead of mass selling $ATOM and collapsing it all, we allow participation from $ATOM, but what is in the README can be improved. Tokenomics people take a shot,\" Kwon said on X.\n\tAccording to X user \"John Galt,\" an expert on Cosmos and head of strategy at Stride Zone, a potential hard fork could resolve years of community infighting and bode well for ATOM token holders.\n\t\"A fork would be very bullish. For years, political tension has impeded the development of Cosmos Hub. Most notably when the ATOM 2.0 proposal was vetoed in the fall of 2022,\" Galt said on X. \"Without Jae's conservatism, Cosmos Hub could be more innovative.\"\n\tBesides, Galt expects the hard fork to lead to the biggest airdrop for ATOM and could result in a massive increase in trading volume for both ATOM and ATOM1 tokens.\n\tAirdrops involve blockchain-based projects and developers sending free tokens to the communities as part of a broader marketing initiative. When a chain splits, the native coin of the new blockchain is usually airdropped to token holders from the original blockchain.\n\t\"Jae is calling the new chain AtomOne (ATOM1). Most of the ATOM1 allocation would go to ATOM stakers pro-rata their amount. Unclear if liquid ATOM is included,\" Galt said.\n\tStill, as of writing, ATOM traded 3.5% lower on the day at $9.59, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency peeped above $10 over the weekend but failed to establish a foothold above the three-week-long resistance. The weakness perhaps stems from bitcoin, the industry leaders, struggling to get past the $38,000 mark.\n\t15:37 UTC: Mentions Cosmos Hub's role in the Cosmos network in the first para.\n\tEdited by Sam Reynolds.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tBitcoin miners are depleting their coin stashes, possibly to ensure the sustainability of operations in the face of the impending halving of per-block rewards from April 20.\n\tThe number of bitcoin held by miners, which receive the coins in return for validating transactions in the blockchain block, declined to 1.794 million BTC this week, the lowest since early 2021, according to data source CoinMetrics.\n\tThe so-called miner balance has fallen by 27,000 since November, implying steady selling in the months leading up to the quadrennial mining reward halving. The pivotal event is set to reduce the per-block BTC emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\n\tThe drawdown in balance contrasts the steady accumulation of about 25,000 BTC in the five months leading up to the previous halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020.\n\tThe change in strategy stems from bitcoin's recent rally to record highs above $73,000. The cryptocurrency has surged 63% this year, surpassing the previous cycle peak of around $69,000 well before the halving. Historically, new highs have come months after the halving.\n\tThe rally has allowed miners to take profits at higher prices and fund equipment upgrades to prepare for the reduced rewards rate, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\n\t\"With miners' holdings still near an all-time high in USD terms ($124 billion), this sell-off appears to be a strategic move for profit-taking and operational upgrades, marking a behavioral change from the last cycle,\" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter.\n\tThe upgrades are evident from the rise in the hashrate, or the total computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions, on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\tThe hashrate has increased by 45% to over 600 exahashes per second over five months, registering a more significant growth than the 15% increase seen ahead of the previous halving.\n\t\"The consistent rise in hashrate suggests that some of the miners are either adding or upgrading their equipment to mitigate the impact of the upcoming halving on revenues,\" Wintermute noted. \"This early investment reflects a positive future outlook and a strategic shift toward long-term operational resilience.\"\n\t11:49 UTC: Corrects second para to say the balance has dropped to lowest since early 2021.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tLayer 1 blockchain Sui has experienced a sharp increase in inflows this month, a spike that has seen it overtake Cardano, Near and Aptos in terms of total value locked (TVL).\n\tThe network, which was built by former Meta (META) employees, now has over $593 million in capital locked across various decentralized finance (DeFI) protocols, more than double its total at the turn of the year when it had $211 million, DefiLlama data shows.\n\tData published by wormholescan.io, which tracks the flow of funds through the cross-chain bridge Wormhole, shows that $310 million had been bridged to Sui from Ethereum in the past 30 days.\n\tSui is often compared to Aptos as they are both built using Move, a programming language that was originally developed at Meta to power the Diem blockchain.\n\tSui experienced a turbulent start after it debuted on Binance’s launchpad in May last year. SUI, as its native token, nosedived 68% in the first five months of trading. This came to a crescendo in October when Sui founders were accused of manipulating token supply, claims they quickly dismissed.\n\tHowever, Sui soon found its stride after a wave of inscription-related activity. First seen on Bitcoin during its recent NFT phase, inscriptions are a way of recording arbitrary data on the blockchain without the use of smart contracts.\n\tOn Dec. 22, Sui produced 13.8 million blocks, with transactions per second (TPS) reaching a peak of 6,000. In contrast to other layers 1s, like Ethereum, gas prices during this high traffic phase decreased, according to a Sui blog post. According to Suiexplorer, there are currently 106 validators operating 413 nodes to secure the Sui blockchain.\n\tThis buoyed the confidence of developers and investors as both the SUI token price and on-chain TVL increased in the following weeks. The two largest protocols on Sui are Scallop Lend and Navi Protocol, two lending platforms that have both seen TVL quadruple since the turn of the year.\n\tSUI is currently trading at $1.80, having risen by 131% since Jan. 1, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 index, which is up by 10% in the same period.\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tAn investor holding a large amount of ether (ETH), a so-called whale, who began trading the Ethereum blockchain's native token in 2017 moved a large chunk of it to crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday, in a possible precursor to liquidating the holding.\n\tRoughly 18 hours ago, the address x50b42514389F25E1f471C8F03f6f5954df0204b0 transferred 12,000 ETH (worth $42.8 million at the time) to Binance, according to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain. That's about 0.01% of the total circulating supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The same address moved nearly 9,000 ETH to Binance on Tuesday, withdrawing 30 million tether (USDT). Tether is the world's largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.\n\t\"A giant whale deposited 12K ETH to Binance 1 hour ago and may sell it,\" Lookonchain posted on X during Wednesday's U.S. trading hours.\n\tMoving coins into addresses tied to cryptocurrency exchanges often indicates an intention to sell or deploy coins as a margin in derivatives trading. Thus, a large inflow of coins frequently presages increased price volatility.\n\tIt's possible the whale was looking to sell the cryptocurrency on the rise. Ether rose 11% to $3,500 on Wednesday, reversing a Tuesday slide. At press time, it was trading at $3,535, according to CoinDesk data.\n\tThe rally occurred even after reports emerged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking to classify ETH as a security, a move that would derail plans for listing spot ether exchange-traded funds in the country and subject ETH and projects interacting with Ethereum to more stringent regulation.\n\tStill, data from Deribit's options market shows traders are more bearish on ether than bitcoin (BTC). While ether's one-week put options trade at a 4% premium to its calls, bitcoin's puts trade at a 2% premium. A similar dynamic is observed in options expiring in one month, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\n\tA put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against an impending price drop.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tBitcoin's (BTC) recent bullish momentum has most bitcoin-holding blockchain addresses sitting on unrealized gains on their investments.\n\tMore than 97% of BTC addresses are now \"in the money,\" according to data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock. That's the highest proportion since November 2021, when the largest cryptocurrency by market value hit a record high around $69,000.\n\tAn address is said to be in the money when BTC's going market rate is above the address' average BTC acquisition cost. In other words, most holders acquired their BTC below the cryptocurrency's current price of about $65,000.\n\tThe data has bullish implications for the market, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\t\"Given the substantial percentage of addresses in profit, the selling pressure from users attempting to break even no longer has a significant effect,\" IntoTheBlock said in a newsletter published Friday, when BTC traded near $62,000.\n\t\"For newcomers entering the market to purchase coins, they are essentially buying from existing users who are already realizing a profit,\" IntoTheBlock said.\n\tBitcoin has risen 54% this year, extending 2022's 154% gain, mainly due to strong inflows into the U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds approved in January. Wall Street's embrace of the spot ETFs has skewed demand-supply dynamics in favor of the bulls, opening the doors for a rally that could propel it toward a new record high.

    "content": "\tLess than 10% of stablecoin transaction volumes are organic or come from real people, according to new findings by Visa and data platform Allium Labs, Bloomberg reported.\n\tOut of about $2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, just $149 billion originated from “organic payments activity,” the report said. The analysis removed transactions done by bots and large-scale traders to “isolate those made by real people.”\n\tThe stablecoin market supply currently stands at about $150 billion, with tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) dominating the market with shares of 75% and 22%, respectively, broker Bernstein has said.\n\tStablecoins are a cryptocurrency tied to another asset class, usually the U.S. dollar, to keep a stable, steady value. They’ve come into sharp focus after PayPal and some others announced they were issuing their stablecoins. Legislation to regulate stablecoins is also seen to be the most likely to make it through the U.S. Congress.\n\t\"There is also a lot of noise in this data given that blockchains are general purpose networks where stablecoins can be used across a range of use cases with transactions that can be initiated manually by an end user or programmatically through bots,\" said a note last month about the findings by Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s Head of Crypto.\n\tDespite the discrepancy between total transfer volume and bot-adjusted transfer volume, the analysis found a steady growth of monthly active stablecoin users, with 27.5 million monthly active users across all chains.\n\tRead More: Stablecoin Bill Unlikely to Get Pinned to FAA Reauthorization, Putting Effort On Hold Again\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tThe ongoing bitcoin (BTC) bull run is characterized by Wall Street’s embrace of the long-awaited spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Still, the rally is producing “millionaires,\" however, at a slower rate than the 2020-2021 uptrend.\n\tThe leading cryptocurrency by market value has risen 70% this year, setting new record highs above $72,000. The rally follows the past year’s 155% surge from the depths of a brutal bear market.\n\tAccording to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko, less than 2,000 millionaires, or wallets with $1 million worth of bitcoin, are created daily. That’s significantly lower than the last bull run, which bred over 4,000 millionaire wallets per day and over 2,000 wallets with a $10 million balance per day.\n\tThe slower pace might mean the bull run is still in the early stages, and the pace of inflows is yet to peak. The conclusion is consistent with market consensus that prices could rise to $150,000 and higher in the coming months due to continued inflows into the spot ETFs and the impending halving-induced supply reduction.\n\t“This [slower growth rate of millionaires] could be due to a few things: (1) New capital has yet to arrive in full force. (2) Large whales are taking profit as BTC hits new highs. (3) Whales are storing their holdings with custodians, rather than personal wallets,” Kaiko said in the weekly newsletter.\n\tRecently, the gap between the liquidity on the ask and bid sides of the order book within 2% of the market price has widened to nearly five times as usual, hinting at a buildup of limit orders on the sell side – a sign of investors looking to take profit near record highs.\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tAs speculation swells to a fever pitch over the imminent approval of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., one clever jokester has apparently gone to the lengths of memorializing the hype into the world's largest blockchain.\n\tWith analysts speculating that the approval could come as soon as Wednesday and that the vehicles theoretically could start trading as early as Thursday, one Bitcoin user posted a transaction late Tuesday that included the encoded message, \"SEC Chairman on the brink of second ETF approval.\"\n\tThe sentence was embedded using Bitcoin's OP_RETURN function, which makes a transaction unspendable but allows for data up to 80 bytes. According to the website mempool.space, which tracks activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, the fee paid was $2.97.\n\tThe SEC has been at the center of intense speculation not only because of the regulator's longstanding opposition to a spot Bitcoin ETF, but also a hack on Tuesday of its official Twitter account that led to a fake posting of an approval announcement, roiling crypto markets.\n\tThe choice of wording for Tuesday's Bitcoin transaction stunt recalls the message purportedly embedded into the blockchain's original \"Genesis\" block in 2009, a headline from British newspaper The Times that read: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"\n\tEdited by Aoyon Ashraf.\n\t\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

That has lifted the total balance held on exchanges to 2.35 million BTC.\n\tAn inflow into exchange wallets is widely taken to represent investors' intention to liquidate their holdings, a potential selling pressure, or deploy coins as a margin in futures and options markets. Meanwhile, an outflow represents accumulation.\n\tThe BTC exchange net position change has been consistently positive since Nov. 1. Historically, such periods have coincided with bull market breathers or price pullbacks.\n\tThat said, the latest inflow could also signify renewed investor confidence in centralized exchanges.\n\tThe safety of coins held in exchange wallets came into question late last year after Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange collapsed, which, at the time, was the third largest. That saw investors move coins off exchanges and into their direct custody.\n\tBitcoin changed hands at $37,170 at press time, according to CoinDesk Indices data, having put in a high of $31,517 late Sunday, supposedly on the back of BTC-supportive Javier Milei's victory in Argentina's Presidential elections.\n\tThe leading cryptocurrency by market value has gained 7.5% this month, extending October's 28% rise, CoinDesk data show.\n\tWe may earn a commission from partner links.

    "title": "Why Polygon's MATIC Token Has Lagged During Past Year's Crypto Rally",
    "time": "2024-02-21",
    "author": "Omkar Godbole",
    "content": "\tThe native token of the Polygon ecosystem (MATIC), a market darling during the 2021 bull run, has been less of a hit with crypto traders over the past year, missing out on a big rally in cryptocurrencies.\n\tThe cryptocurrency declined about 32% in 12 months, significantly underperforming rival layer-2 coins like OP and SKL, which have risen 216%, 46% and 50%, respectively, according to CoinDesk Indices. Arbitrum’s ARB, which has existed for less than a year, has seen more significant gains than MATIC in six months.\n\tBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has more than doubled to $51,700 in one year, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, the broader market gauge, has risen 70%. Ethereum's native token, ether (ETH), is up 76%.\n\tMATIC’s dismal performance is in contrast to 2021, when the token was on a tear, producing market-beating triple-digit price gains even during the corrective phases of the bull run.\n\tIndeed, the excitement back then might have been due to the project's then-front-runner status as the leading sidechain – a type of auxiliary network – for Ethereum.\n\tBut the technological race has since shifted, with investors and developers alike now favoring a different type of scaling networks known as \"rollups.\"\n\tPolygon has pivoted, setting up Polygon zkEVM, employs ZK-rollup technology, bundling and processing transactions outside the Ethereum main chain. Polygon's biggest rivals, Arbitrum and Optimism, are other popular Ethereum scaling solutions, based on a slightly different but popular technology known as \"optimistic rollups.\"\n\tBut Polygon is still supporting its legacy chain, known as Polygon PoS, which uses the Plasma framework with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\tPolygon is now pushing Polygon CDK, a \"chain development kit\" built around the ZK tech that can be used by other developers to spin up their own layer-2 networks. Last week, Polygon claimed a technological feat with its release of a \"Type 1 prover,\" a new component allowing any network compatible with Ethereum's EVM standard to become a layer-2 network powered by zero-knowledge proofs.\n\tPolygon officials declined to provide a comment for this story.\n\tIt's possible the months-long turnaround strategy may be starting to show signs of a payoff. In the past month, MATIC has gained 24%, versus 14% climb during that period in the benchmark CoinDesk 20 index of the largest digital assets.\n\tPolygon is set to come out soon with a new protocol known as the \"aggregation layer\" or \"AggLayer\" aiming to unite \"a divided blockchain landscape into a web of ZK-secured L1 and L2 chains that feels like a single chain.\" Along with the sprint to roll out Polygon CDK, such initiatives could shift the investor mood.\n\tBut the lack of investor interest in the token over the past year could stem from a couple of reasons, including the way Polygon zkEVM ensures the validity of transactions, which puts it at a disadvantage to Optimism and Arbitrum when it comes to benefitting from Ethereum’s impending Dencun upgrade, according to Katie Talati, director of research at digital-asset management firm Arca.\n\tEthereum’s Dencun upgrade, slated for March 12, will introduce a new type of transaction called a blob, attaching large, fixed-sized data chunks to a regular transaction (imagine side carts on a motorcycle). Unlike call data or the memory permanently used to store transaction details, blob-carrying transactions only include a reference hash to the blob’s data stored off-chain and become inaccessible after three weeks or so.\n\tIn other words, blobs will reduce transaction costs and boost efficiency by delivering large data packets to recipients without congesting the main net.\n\tThe upgrade is particularly favorable for layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon zkEVM that use the rollup technology. Rollups bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then submit the data to the Ethereum main chain for verification. The main chain, however, often faces congestion, which raises the cost of submitting data to the main chain.\n\tAfter the upgrade, rollups could store their transaction data using blobs, freeing up space on the mainnet and processing more transactions at a lesser cost.\n\tThat said, Polygon zkEVM functions on the principle of “guilty until found innocent.” The rollup operators must provide proof of validity to finalize transactions on Ethereum. This resource-intensive task will continue adding to the overall transaction cost after the Dencun upgrade.\n\tOn the other hand, Optimistic rollups operate on the “innocent until proven” principle and must produce a fraud-proof flag only when the transaction is challenged. Thus, they stand to benefit from the expected decline in transaction costs following the Dencun upgrade.\n\t“The upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade will decrease costs for layer 2's to post data back to the Ethereum mainnet. Although Polygon will benefit from the upgrade, other L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism, which use optimistic rollups, will see more significant cost reductions, which has caused these L2s to rally,” Talati told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\t“Most of the cost for optimistic rollups comes from posting transaction data back to Ethereum (which is what Dencun will reduce), but they hardly post fraud proofs. On the other hand, Zk rollups post fraud proofs far more frequently and, therefore, would not see the benefits of lower transaction data costs,” Talati explained.\n\tOn the other hand, since Polygon typically posts more data to Ethereum, it might stand to benefit more from the Dencun changes.\n\tFormer Polygon President Ryan Wyatt’s decision to move to Optimism could be another reason for the lack of a notable uptrend in MATIC.\n\t“The second reason for the underperformance is that Ryan Wyatt, the former president of Polygon, left last year to join as the head of business development for Optimism. Many believe that Wyatt was responsible for Polygon’s big partnerships, and his exit has been a considerable blow to Polygon’s growth efforts,” Talati said.\n\tThe MATIC price rose 2.5% when Wyatt's departure was disclosed on July 7, the same day it was announced that Marc Boiron had been promoted to CEO.\n\tData tracked by DefiLama shows that Arbitrum is the fourth-largest chain, with a 24-hour trading volume of $420 million. Polygon PoS ranks 6th, with a trading volume of $179 million, followed by Optimism’s $133 million.\n\tArbitrum is also the leading rollup, with $3 billion worth of assets locked in its decentralized finance protocols. Optimism is the second largest, with $884 million, while Polygon ZkEVM ranks 12th, with total value locked at $14.7 million.\n\t“The toughest competitor to MATIC is Arbitrum (ARB), and unfortunately for MATIC, Arbitrum is the go-to blockchain for traders,” Kenny Hearn, chief investment officer at SwissOne Capital, said in an email, adding that Arbitrum is leading the surge in DeFi trading volumes.\n\tAccording to Hearn, MATIC was overvalued at the start of the ongoing crypto market uptrend, and other layer-2 coins are playing catchup.\n\t“Looking into the numbers, one can easily find the relative valuations stacking up. The top 10 apps’ TVL on each chain totals ARB $1.9bn, MATIC $800mn. Then, comparing their Fully-Diluted Valuations (FDV) of $20bn and $10bn, respectively, the relative valuations make more sense,” Hearn noted.\n\t“When comparing tokenomics, both ARB and OPT are still rewarding stakers though native token unlocks, and like it or not, it can add to reducing token supply on exchanges while rewarding Pool/TVL contributors,” he added.\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra and Bradley Keoun.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "title": "Ahead of EU Elections, Crypto Industry Pushes Blockchain Merits as Policy Focus Shifts to AI",
    "time": "2024-04-30",
    "author": "Sandali Handagama",
    "content": "\tThe European Union’s more than 370 million eligible voters are set to elect 720 parliamentarians this June – and while tech policy focus has shifted to artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain industry bodies are vying to prove the technology is vital to the bloc’s digitization efforts.\n\tThe EU has already established the world’s first comprehensive crypto rules alongside strict anti-money laundering measures for the sector. But with revisions to the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation likely in the works and the legislation's two key architects’ political futures up in the air, Europe’s crypto industry is bracing itself for change.\n\tChange could mean a number of things, including the industry potentially losing the handful of lawmakers who really know crypto or a slackening of new policymaking. More challenging still is getting ahead of shaping the sector’s new role in a discourse centered on artificial intelligence (AI) – something the EU has already started legislating.\n\tEarlier this year, four leading EU industry groups joined forces to pen a manifesto pledging to promote the use of blockchain tech in the bloc to avoid falling behind “in the global race” towards a digital economy.\n\tThe groups say the timing for the manifesto is “crucial considering the upcoming elections and political changes Europe will undergo” this year and makes a case for continuing work on blockchain.\n\t“While we recognize the intrinsic value of technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and robotics, we believe that blockchain will serve as the trust layer for the convergence of all these technologies, allowing them to build upon each other and form the framework of the future digital economy,” the manifesto said.\n\tThe associations’ hope is that a new and hopefully younger parliament will be easier to approach than the last – at least where digitization is concerned.\n\tFor crypto and blockchain policy in particular, political parties may matter less than lawmakers’ age, according to Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, one of the four industry associations that collaborated on the manifesto.\n\t“If you have a wallet full of crypto, you're much more open to the idea that this will be part of the future economy, right? Because you have it, you know how it works, you understand it,” Kopitsch said during an interview with CoinDesk.\n\tMarina Markezic, co-founder of the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), which also collaborated on the manifesto, says younger politicians are likely to be more tech-savvy as well.\n\t“So it would be, like, kind of also easier to explain, to talk to them” about blockchain technology, Markezic said.\n\tBut first, things overall might potentially slow down, according to Benedikt Faupel at German digital industry association Bitkom, “just because we don't know how the elections play out.”\n\tCrypto policy in the European Parliament (EP) didn’t have a lot of support to begin with and was spearheaded by “mostly three or four people,” Markezic said.\n\tKopitsch and Markezic agree that Greek politician and former EP Vice President Eva Kaili was crypto’s driving force in government. Kaili’s dismissal from Parliament over a high-profile corruption scandal was seen as a blow to policy efforts, but thanks to German lawmaker Stefan Berger, MiCA made it through to the end of the line.\n\tBerger, who was the rapporteur for the package and in charge of handling the framework through negotiations, helped stamp an effort by the EP’s Green politicians to limit the use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism that would have effectively banned Bitcoin in the union.\n\t“He did so much,” said Markezic, referring to Berger’s work on MiCA.\n\tBerger is currently rapporteur for the EU’s legislative proposals for a digital euro but is also up for re-election this June. According to Jonas Gross, head of the Digital Euro Association, the outcomes of an election of this scale are tough to predict, and it’s “infeasible to discuss specific officials who might not be back this year.”\n\t“We do see that the European Parliament is currently – under the guidance of Stefan Berger – following a very innovative and open-minded approach when it comes to crypto assets, stablecoins and the digital euro,” Gross added. “It would be desirable to get a Parliament in place that has a similar innovative focus to bring these digital money-related topics further forward so that it benefits the EU.”\n\tAnother architect of MiCA whose future is up in the air is Mairead McGuinness, who serves as the commissioner for financial stability. MiCA was proposed by the European Commission under McGuinness’ purview. She has said she won’t be contesting in the 2024 parliamentary elections but is open to staying on another term as Commissioner – though that decision ultimately rests with the EU's overarching government.\n\tWith MiCA mostly out of the way, another key framework for some crypto watchers is the EU’s push for a central bank digital currency, which is stoking controversy – and even conspiracy theories – with some politicians raising concerns that a digital euro could give the EU governments too much power and access to private information.\n\tAccording to Anne-Sophie Gógl, executive board member of the Digital Euro Association, some right-wing political parties are using plans for a digital euro to “create a mood against the European Union.”\n\t“They are using words such as control and surveillance. They also accuse the digital euro of excluding marginalized groups,” Gógl said in a written statement. “We fear that this trend will also have an impact in Europe after the elections: a larger proportion of right-wing populist representatives in the EP and therefore the risk that the topic of the digital euro will be misused for misinformation.”\n\tPolls are projecting rising support for the far right, but likely not enough to tip the scales in favor of anti-EU sentiment this election.\n\tIf these parties do snag a nice chunk of new seats though, it could “massively slow down the policymaking process” for a digital euro, Gógl said.\n\tThe EU’s tech policy priorities have shifted away from crypto to focus on AI, and the crypto industry is pushing for the application of blockchain technology in conjunction with AI, according to Anja Blaj, policy expert at EUCI.\n\t“What we are arguing most of the time is that AI alone raises a lot of fears as well, and how those fears can be quite often addressed is through blockchain technology,” Blaj said, referring to arguments that blockchain could be used to help preserve the integrity of data fed to AI systems and decentralize them.\n\tThis won’t be the first time industry bodies pushed for the acceptance of blockchain technology over the adoption of speculative assets. During the last bear market, which saw several crypto giants fall, the industry quickly pivoted to promoting blockchain applications in traditional finance and other areas at events such as the World Economic Forum.\n\t“What people are actually moving away from is the financial connotation of the blockchain industry. So quite often, we actually push for the narrative of focusing on the ReFi of regenerative finance… supply chains or how, for example, data can be handled,” Blaj said during an interview with CoinDesk.\n\tRegenerative Finance (ReFi) sees cryptocurrency projects investing in sustainability in an effort to fix some of the problems markets create.\n\tSetting up blockchain as something vital to the digitization of Europe may prove critical to the industry’s survival in the region.\n\tWhen the current government was formed, “there was a lot of hype around blockchain,” and Europe was the first to get moving on policy and initiatives, Markezic said.\n\t“Now it is more on AI and… why would you use your political power in order to talk about something that might not be that present anymore?” Markezic said of the risk of fading political interest in blockchain.\n\tThe elections will take place from June 6 to 9.\n\tEdited by Nikhilesh De.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tBlockchains may be transparent, but Solana's data-heavy ledger might be better described as translucent. A new block explorer called Quantum is vying to change that.\n\tBuilt by the the team behind SolanaFM, the overhauled block explorer prioritizes simplicity in its presentation of what's happening on the Solana blockchain, its developers say. That's a notable difference from many other Solana ecosystem explorers, many of which (including SolanaFM) are detail-oriented at the expense of easy readability.\n\tThe service, which already has 53,000 signups, debuts as the entire Solana ecosystem emerges from a prolonged downtrend, led by the rallying price of SOL itself. It's trading at $59 at press time, up from $19 during the depth of the bear market.\n\tFor users wanting to make sense of the on-chain data, these transaction browsers help humans parse the mountains of crucial but imperceptible data that prove X token went to Y address.\n\t\"You don't want to have to be running a sophisticated computer system to be able to\" make sense of a blockchain, the former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried said during his recent trial (the judge had asked him to explain what block explorers are). \"So there are a variety of providers that created websites that listed out in a centralized but easy-to-view fashion all of the transfers on the Blockchains.\"\n\tSolanaFM is one of a handful of such companies building these websites for the Solana blockchain, whose transactions are notoriously not \"easy-to-view.\" The high speed blockchain creates reams of unstandardized data that block explorers struggle to present in an intuitive way. Solana ecosystem explorers are nowhere near as streamlined as Ethereum's Etherscan.\n\tBy SolanaFM's own count its eponymous block explorer is the Solana ecosystem's third most popular, behind the first-to-market portal from the Solana Foundation and another from a third-party service called SolScan.\n\t\"We realize our explorer was overbranded\" because first-timers thought it was a podcast, SolanaFM CEO Nicholas Chen said.\n\tHe's trying to eat away at the incumbents' \"huge market share\" by changing his explorer's name to Quantum but perhaps more importantly improving its user experience: basically, its presentation of all that head-scratching data.\n\t\"Users in general get a less detailed UI, but are straight to the point, splashing information that's ESSENTIAL for them to understand what they’re reading in less than 3 seconds,\" he said.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tCosmos-based layer-1 blockchain Canto unveiled its \"Cyclone Stack,\" aimed at scaling and improving performance. It is also reversing course on its previously announced plan to shift to an Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\tCanto, a blockchain designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, first announced in September that it would become an Ethereum layer-2 network using Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK). The team clarified on Friday, however, that it will continue to function as a Cosmos-based layer-1 network. It will run Polygon's type-1 prover, plugging into their aggregation layer (AggLayer) designed to unify blockchain liquidity.\n\t\"Over the past few months we’ve been working closely with the polygon team doing research on the integration, and came to conclusion that we’ll be using their Type-1 prover to stay an L1 instead of becoming an L2,\" a representative for Canto told CoinDesk in an email. \"Consensus for this decision was made amongst all of the major contributors of Canto\" and the project will tap into Polygon's AggLayer after Canto has finished some other upgrades, the representative added.\n\tCanto announced Friday that it is pushing ahead with its new Cyclone Stack update, which will consist of three key upgrades called the Callisto Upgrade, the Kallichore Upgrade and the Elara Upgrade. According to a Canto statement reviewed by CoinDesk, the upgrade is designed to speed up block times, increase storage access speeds and set new standards for execution.\n\tCanto says its Cyclone stack will also be fully compatible with all EVM tooling and applications. (EVM stands for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is the software that executes smart contracts, and helps blockchains like Canto support applications built for compatibility with Ethereum and similar chains).\n\t“This comprehensive upgrade suite signifies a big step towards achieving high performance and scalability for Canto,” according to the press release. “Through these innovations, Canto is enhancing its platform for both developers and users alike.”\n\tRead more: The Plight of Hyped-Blockchain Canto Demonstrates Dreary DeFi Outlook\n\tCORRECTION (March 15, 16:18 UTC): Following this story's publication, a Canto representative clarified that the team has reversed course on its plan to transition to an Ethereum layer-2 network powered by Polygon's CDK. Canto will remain a layer 1 blockchain and run Polygon's type-1 prover.

    "time": "2024-01-11",
    "author": "Sam Kessler\nMargaux Nijkerk",
    "content": "\tEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested raising the network's gas limit by 33% on Wednesday – a move that would raise the network's transaction capacity and could reduce fees for end-users, but could increase operational costs for validators.\n\tUsers of the Ethereum blockchain pay gas fees to ensure that their transactions are added to the network, and the gas that one pays to execute a transaction roughly correlates to its computational complexity (e.g. a simple token swap will cost less gas than opening up a convoluted lending position).\n\tEthereum's gas limit refers to the total amount of gas that can be squeezed into an individual Ethereum block – the bundles of transactions that get added to the Ethereum network at regular intervals. Increasing the gas limit would mean increasing the amount (and complexity) of transactions that can be added to a block.\n\tButerin made the gas increase suggestion during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session featuring the Ethereum Foundation Research group.\n\t\"The gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, which is the longest time ever in the protocol's history,\" Buterin wrote in response to a commenter who asked whether Ethereum could \"safely increase\" its gas limit. Buterin suggested increasing the gas limit to 40 million gas units – a 33% increase over today's 30 million limit.\n\tA ramp-up in Ethereum's gas limit wouldn't require a big update or \"hard fork\" of the network's core code. Instead, the validators that operate the network should be able to implement the change by adjusting certain parameters in their node software.\n\tCalls for increasing the gas limit started back in December when some of Ethereum's layer 2 (L2) networks were experiencing record usage. Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, wrote on X that for “Ethereum to become a settlement layer for L2s it needs to increase its block gas limit.”\n\tFollowing Buterin’s Reddit comments on Wednesday, more users on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, chimed in with words of support for the suggested increase. Jesse Pollak, the head of protocols at Coinbase and creator of the layer-2 blockchain Base, shared his support of the move and suggested the gas limit could even be increased even further, to 45 million.\n\tOthers expressed more caution about the gas change, like Ethereum core developer Dankrad Feist, who suggested that calldata and blobs per block should be targeted in addition to the overall gas limit.\n\tAs for what the limit increase accomplishes, \"it simply allows more activity on L1 - it will either reduce tx costs - or more likely IMO just increase capacity at similar cost -> more burn,” said Köppelmann.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tIndian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday.\n\tThe aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\tThe objective of Okto’s points program is to bootstrap the launch of the Okto blockchain, which will happen later in 2024. That’s also when the launch of the OKTO token to power that chain will occur. The points program will reward users for their on-chain transactions, and those trading elsewhere can earn bonus points by moving assets to the Okto Wallet. As much as 7% of the OKTO token will be air-dropped to early users.\n\tCoinDCX launched Okto in August 2022 as a DeFi mobile app with an inbuilt wallet aimed at easing the transition of crypto consumers to DeFi. Since then, it has spent nearly two years testing ways to solve the problem of a broken user experience to engage the next billion Web3 users.\n\t“Self-custody wallet experience was completely broken and required users to go through several hurdles of the Web3 space like blockchain, self-custody, security and trust, signing transactions or gas fees,\" said Khandelwal. “Okto is the first such system which provides a Web 2-like single click mobile experience in the Web3.\"\n\tThe idea of creating a native experience was made possible in phases by first, working on a solution internally to streamline the process of using DeFi's various elements.\n\tIn phase two, the solution was packaged into a software development kit (SDK), which is a bundle of software development tools, and made available to external entities in a centralized scenario. This allowed developers to build applications without needing to understand the intricacies of each blockchain.\n\t“Post experiencing the challenges of building a full chain abstracted Okto wallet, in Phase 2, we introduced the Okto Web3 SDK, an industry-first embedded wallet enabling any app or internet company to fully harness the potential of Web3,\" Khandelwal said. ”We are now in the process of building an entire Okto Ecosystem.\"\n\t\"We believed all CeFi platforms would eventually have a DeFi arm,\" said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. “The Okto Chain will power thousands of applications being built in the Web3 space.\"\n\tMore than 20 apps are being built through the SDK, 50+ chains and protocols have been integrated, and over a million wallets have been created on what they call the \"Okto Orchestration Layer.”\n\t“We are not just targeting one partner or ecosystem but hope to land several partnerships to help us make this globally ubiquitous,” Khandelwal said without naming any specific entity.\n\tRead More: What’s at Stake for Crypto in India as the World’s Largest Democracy Is in the Midst of Its National Election?\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\t\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tFrench soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain said it will become a network validator for the Chiliz Chain blockchain that hosts its PSG fan tokens, and use the money it generates to buy them back on a regular basis.\n\tSports clubs have dipped their toes in crypto over the years through the creation of fan tokens, which can be used for sports memorabilia and experiences, however this is the first time a club is getting involved as a blockchain validator. Validators are entities that manage blockchain nodes, securing the network through functions including transaction verification and smart-contract authorization. In exchange, validators generate revenue from running a node.\n\tThe club, currently leading France's Ligue 1 competition, introduced its fan token in September 2018. The token now has a market cap of $28 million, according to CoinMarketCap data. The buy-back program will allow PSG to \"regularly refresh\" its fan token reserves and help build a sustainable digital economy around them, Chiliz said.\n\t\"We will optimize our future engagements for network effects, amplifying the value and revenue each stakeholder can generate and experience within this new digital economy,\" Pär Helgosson, Paris Saint-Germain's head of Web3, said in a statement.\n\tThe Chiliz native token (CHZ) rose by 10% to $0.133 on the news with its market cap rising to $1.15 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\tOther big-name soccer clubs with tokens on Chiliz include FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Arsenal, Inter Milan and AC Milan.\n\tParis Saint-Germain also announced that it will host a hackathon event at its Parc Des Princes in the coming months in an event that will be co-hosted by Chiliz.\n\tUPDATE (Feb. 22, 13:15 UTC): Adds CHZ price reaction.\n\tEdited by Sheldon Reback.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "time": "2024-04-24",
    "author": "Amitoj Singh",
    "content": "\tIndia’s general election in 2024 is not expected to immediately affect crypto policy, and its current – restrictive – rules are expected to continue on through the upcoming Parliamentary term.\n\tThe world’s most populated country and the fastest growing major economy kicked off its multi-phased elections this month, with results expected on June 4, 2024. Several industry analysts told CoinDesk they don't expect any changes to crypto policy after the next term's lawmakers are elected, resulting in the near-term continuation of rules that have stifled the nation's digital asset ecosystem.\n\tPrime Minister Narendra Modi, 73, is aiming for a third five-year term as the face of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), and is overwhelmingly expected to win the elections, pre-election surveys have shown.\n\tSuch is his expected dominance that the Indian National Congress (INC), the major opposition party and several regional parties, around 40 in total, have come together to form a coalition called I.N.D.I.A (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) to fight him.\n\tThe election is for 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, referred to as the Lok Sabha. The party or alliance with the most seats would select the country's prime minister and form a government.\n\tCrypto’s significance as an election issue remains non-existent or at best negligible. Web3 remains esoteric for an overwhelming majority of the voting population. Even the fact that India has implemented a steep tax deducted at source on crypto transactions (1% on every transaction) is unlikely to play a role in this year's election in any major way.\n\tIssues such as lack of jobs, a Hindu-nationalist agenda against a constitutionally enshrined secularism, alleged marginalization of minorities, the role of electoral bonds, institutional independence and agrarian policies have dominated the headlines, making sure that crypto is not even a political talking point.\n\t“Indian elections are still focussed mainly around socio-political issues,” said Kiran Vivekananda, Chief Public Policy officer at one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, CoinDCX. “Technology has started becoming an agenda item but is more from the setting up [of a] manufacturing base in India and the job-creation lens.”\n\tYet, Vivekananda expressed hope that the incoming government would work more closely with the industry to understand its challenges, provide solutions and protect the interests of citizens. However, other entrepreneurs believe more needs to be done by the Indian crypto industry.\n\t“Developments in the U.S. show that crypto can indeed become a political talking point, influencing policy and voter choices,” said Ashish Khandelwal, founder of Anq, a digital banking platform and a person who has been engaging with legislators. “To mirror the U.S., the Indian crypto industry needs to highlight how the tech can offer more than just investment opportunities, creating awareness around tangible benefits.”\n\tNeither major party, Modi’s BJP nor the INC, have mentioned the words cryptocurrency, blockchain or Web3 in their manifestos. However, this isn’t necessarily reflective of their plans toward the ecosystem. Indian government and political stakeholders, like other nations, have often used euphemisms to refer to the crypto-related space.\n\tThe ruling BJP’s manifesto said the party would educate senior citizens to avoid digital scams, take stringent action against those who threaten the nation’s digital sovereignty and would develop “Digital Public Infrastructure to remove information asymmetry in agriculture.”\n\tThe Congress Party (another name for INC) said it would give farmers the option to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement of the produce on a “digital ledger” and “work on digital/cybersecurity issues that may threaten India's digital financial infrastructure.”\n\tSo far, during Modi's second term, his crypto-related policies included stiff taxes including a 30% tax on profits from selling digital assets, no off-setting of losses, a 1% tax deducted at source for every transaction and mandated registration of exchanges with India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. These policies and other enforcement related actions brought the industry to its knees.\n\tOnly the recent bull run and the government’s banning of off-shore exchanges at the nudging of India’s crypto policy advocacy body appears to have brought some respite to the industry.\n\tThe Modi government “has consistently maintained a lukewarm stance towards cryptocurrencies,” putting in place a “patchwork of regulations,” said Mohit Chawdhry, a fellow at the Esya Centre Think Tank which has extensively researched how the crypto policies have so far impacted the industry.\n\tA weak opposition party has not framed a comprehensive position on crypto policy, though at this point it is simply fighting for survival against the Modi juggernaut.\n\tRegardless of how Parliament shakes out, India’s Web3 policies are expected to remain largely unchanged in the near future.\n\tIn the more likely scenario of Modi winning, his policies are expected to continue, and even if they would be updated, crypto is unlikely to be an immediate priority. Modi’s government has made no public indications that once it comes to power, crypto policy may be updated.\n\tIn another, less likely, scenario of the opposition alliance winning, the coalition government is likely to have other priorities. The coalition has not yet indicated any thoughts on how its members may approach crypto policy.\n\tThe best case scenario for a change in India’s crypto policy is around the end of 2024,\n\tone person familiar with the framing of crypto regulations in the government but unauthorized to speak to reporters told CoinDesk.\n\tAnd this isn't due to any specific policies that may be updated or introduced – it will simply take the government months to transition into governing after election results are announced in six weeks.\n\tThe Modi government “does not appear to be keen on a holistic policy framework for virtual digital assets,” said the Esya Centre's Chawdhry. “It seems that other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and extended reality, are higher priorities for policymakers.”\n\tRecently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman remained slightly ambiguous about crypto, saying the government’s position has always been that crypto assets can be traded, but that the government hasn't regulated them in the past, and won't change that stance yet.\n\tThe past few years of the Modi government indicate changes will come.\n\tOne of the major achievements touted by the Modi government has been its role in shaping globally coordinated crypto policy under its 2023 presidency of the Group of 20. India made it a priority and brought the major economies of the world to agree to a set of guidelines.\n\tIndia has also purportedly achieved its ambitions with the digital rupee.\n\t\"The policymaking process for crypto will definitely pick up pace in this (expected and upcoming) term of the Modi government,” said Tanvi Ratna, the founder and CEO of the emerging technology think tank Policy 4.0, which contributed to key research and inputs towards the G20 policy framework created under India.\n\t“We can expect a close alignment between the government strategy [and] the global framework agreed by the G20 under India's leadership. Also worth noting that India's crypto policy will evolve alongside the scale up and launch of the eRupee. We are looking towards a very dynamic five years in India,” Ratna said.\n\tRead More: India Won't See Crypto or Web3 Bill for Another 18 Months, Senior Lawmaker Tells CoinDesk\n\tEdited by Nikhilesh De.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

That period was 10 months long, ASIC said.\n\tIn 2022, ASIC sued BPS, asking the court to rule that the entire Qoin project, the token, blockchain, and wallet, was a financial product that required a license.\n\tIn Australia, ASIC has seen both victories and losses as it ramps up regulatory oversight through legal processes.\n\tPart of this case was ASIC's allegation that the Qoin Blockchain and the Qoin Wallets constituted one single scheme, but the court disagreed.\n\t\"Contrary to ASIC’s submissions, the Qoin Blockchain, a means of acquiring Qoin and a means whereby business operators who hold Qoin Wallets can register as Qoin Merchants are not components of, and are not themselves, the mechanism which allows the user to make the non-cash payment,\" the order said.\n\tExperts said the court made an important rejection of ASIC’s attempts to have an entire blockchain found to be part of a \"financial product\" under Australian law.\n\t“This is an important judicial recognition of blockchains as foundational technology where the use of the technology if it breaches the law, can (and should) be prosecuted, but the technology itself stands separate,\" said Blockchain Australia Chair and Digital Assets Lawyer Michael Bacina.\n\tThe order asked ASIC and BPS to confer and agree on a form of an order that would resolve the remaining questions, including penalties for later this month.\n\tRead More: Australian Court Dismisses Lawsuit by Market Regulator Against Finder in 'Landmark' Ruling for Crypto Industry\n\tEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tBlockchain analytics firm TRM Labs has partnered with Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx in an effort to combat scams in the nation, an announcement on Monday said.\n\tThe program will trial an apparent global first in which Aussie crypto users who activate two-factor authentication on their cryptocurrency accounts will be paid AUD 10 (USD 6.6) worth of Bitcoin. It has been launched to coincide with the Australian government's Scam Awareness Week (Nov. 27th to Dec. 1st). The trial will test the impact on investment fraud levels of rewarding crypto customers for protecting their accounts and educating themselves about how to avoid scams, the announcement said.\n\tTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process requiring two forms of identification to access resources. The method provides a higher level of security than single-factor processes, in which the user provides a single form of identification, usually a password or passcode.\n\tEver since the collapse of FTX, Australia has taken steps to tighten its crypto regulation policy. The year 2023 has seen Australian regulators take action against crypto-related companies such as Block Earner and eToro. Blockchain industry stakeholders in Australia have taken a stand against restrictions on crypto payments by local banks. The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) was one such platform that applied partial restrictions citing scams. Binance Australia also halted deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer \"due to a decision made\" by a third-party payment service provider. Australia's government and the Blockchain industry then appeared to have reached a compromise.\n\tIn 2022, Aussies reported a loss of AUD 221 million (USD 146 million) in cryptocurrency, an increase of 162.4% from the previous year, according to the announcement. This year, Swyftx has stopped AUD 3 million in customer funds from going to scammers.\n\tThe initial 2,000 customers who enable two-factor authentication on their accounts and complete a course co-created with TRM Labs will be paid the reward by Swyftx. The partnership also encourages customers to report suspected fraud on chainabuse.com, a free scam-reporting website operated by TRM Labs. Customers can check addresses before engaging with them on the website.\n\tAustralia expects to release draft legislation that covers licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024.\n\tRead More: ISIS Allies Used Crypto to Raise Millions: TRM Labs\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

    "content": "\tThe percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply that last moved on-chain at least a year ago has declined to the lowest since October 2022, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\tOn Monday, 12.95 million BTC, equating to 65.84% of the circulating supply of 19.67 million BTC, remained unchanged for over a year, the lowest percentage since October 2022. The metric peaked above 70% with the debut of nearly a dozen spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in mid-January and has been falling ever since.\n\tSince late December, the percentage of the circulating supply that has not moved in at least two years has declined to 54.% from 57.4%.\n\tThe decline likely represents profit-taking by investors who held coins for one year and over and marks a shift from the holding strategy seen through 2023.\n\tThe urge to sell likely stems from bitcoin's massive 148% price surge since April last year and the 50% rally since the ETFs began trading in the U.S. At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $70,400. However, it's difficult to ascertain the exact percentage of bitcoin that left the inactive supply has been liquidated in the market.\n\tAccording to the data tracking website MacroMicro, a decrease in the percentage of inactive BTC is a \"leading indicator for the end of the bull run.\"\n\tPast data, however, show that bull markets tend to peak as the percentage of inactive supply bottoms out and begin rising.\n\tEdited by Oliver Knight.\n\tDisclosure\n\tPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.
