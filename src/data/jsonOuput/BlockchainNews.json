    "content": "\tIn pursuit of becoming a global crypto hub, the United Kingdom seeks to revamp the traditional financial market using distributed ledger technology (DLT), according to the finance ministry, as reported by Reuters.\n\tBy live testing crypto blockchain technology in activities like settlement and trading of bonds and stocks, the UK intends to make the financial market more efficient and innovative for users.\n\tPer the report:\n\t“In financial markets, the trading of stocks, bonds, and other assets traditionally involves three distinct activities of trading, clearing, and settlement. Using DLT could change this and allow financial assets such as bonds or stocks to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks.”\n\tDLT projects will be tested using a financial market infrastructure dubbed “sandbox” from next year, according to the ministry’s director-general for financial services, Gwyneth Nurse. “A sandbox will allow testing new regulatory best practices and making permanent changes to ensure market users benefit,” Nurse added.\n\tNurse also pointed out that the Bank of England and the finance ministry were delving deeper into the digital pound as a public consultation was expected later this year.\n\tThe sandbox is expected to be rolled out simultaneously with the stablecoin regulation.\n\tIt seems a race against time for global governments to put up guardrails in the stablecoin arena following the shocking collapse of the algorithmic TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, which triggered the loss of approximately $60 billion.\n\tMeanwhile, In Asia, Japan recently passed a law stipulating that stablecoins would only be issued by licensed banks, trust companies, and registered money transfer agents to protect investors.\n",

    "time": "2020-04-02",
    "author": "Lucas Cacioli",
    "content": "\tUS Federal Judge P. Kevin Castel has denied Telegram’s request to issue its Gram tokens to overseas investors.\n\tTelegram had filed an appeal to last week’s ruling by a United Stated federal court in favour of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is prohibiting the issuance of Gram tokens for the time being.\n\tIn the most recent turn in Telegram’s six-month court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the legal status of the former’s $1.7 billion Gram token offering in 2018, the US courts have ruled that the injunction barring Telegram from issuing its Gram tokens is applicable to all potential investors both in the United State and overseas.\n\tCourts Continue to Side with SEC\n\tIn Telegram’s notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the company cited the SEC’s lack of jurisdiction with overseas investors and even made the suggestion that it would implement safe-guards to protect against “non-US Private Placement purchasers reselling Grams to US purchasers in the future.”\n\tJudge Castel argued that Telegram had not provided enough evidence that it could implement these types of safeguards and cited that, “the TON Blockchain was designed and is intended to grant anonymity to those who purchase or sell Grams,” meaning that the proposed safeguard would be unenforceable in the real-world.\n\tThe order also points out that the question of the SEC’s jurisdiction has not been previously raised by Telegram, and said at this point it is too late to consider it.\n\tWill TCF Launch TON without Telegram?\n\tAs the picture is starting to look very grim for the launch of the Telegram Open Network (TON), some in the TON Community Foundation came forward with contingency alternatives on March 26: notably their ability to launch with or without the messaging platform’s further participation and without regulator approval.\n\tAs the US Courts appear to be siding with regulators, granting a temporary halt on Gram distribution; the TON Community Foundation’s founder, Fedor Skuratov said that the community is seriously considering options like launching the network without Telegram.\n\tSkuratov said “Strictly speaking, no additional measures are required to launch TON by the community, except for a consensus within the community. But in order to get recognized, we will need to come to an agreement with investors (at least, with a majority of them).\"\n\tSkuratov highlighted that all the code necessary to launch TON is available online as it was published as open-source by Telegram. He explained that they would merely need to create the genesis block and could run the network on a minimum of 13 validators.\n\tWhile the US Securities and Exchange Commission may have temporarily succeeded in stopping the launch of Telegram’s TON network, can they really stop open-source technology?\n",

    "content": "\tAccording to data from block explorer, Etherscan, the attacker of the TempleDAO hack, has moved the funds stolen via the recently sanctioned crypto mixer, Tornado Cash.\n\tThis information was first disclosed by blockchain data firm on Sunday, PeckShield. A roughly amount of ETH was seen transferred from an address supposed to be that of the TempleDAO hacker to the Tornado Cash platform. The transaction started with a deposit of 0.1, and ETHoccurred place within hours on Sunday.\n\tTornado Cash is an Ethereum-based crypto mixer used to anonymize transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In August, the platform got sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\tDeclaring that the crypto mixer is mainly associated with high-profile hacks such as the Ronin and Harmony breaches. Specifically, OFAC claimed the crypto mixer benefited North Korea's Lazarus Group and that the platform has been used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto since its launch.\n\tLast week, TempleDAO, a protocol staking platform, suffered a hack on one of its staking vaults. As seen on Etherscan, the hacker made away with 1,830 ETH, which was roughly $2.3 million at the time.\n\tNotably, this hack comes amid the rise of cryptocurrency hacks this month. According to new data from Chainanalysis, October 2022 is the month with the most hacking activity ever.\n\tThe data averred roughly 11 hacks amounting to $718 million happened this month alone. Chainanalysis stated, \"At this rate, 2022 will likely surpass 2021 as the biggest year for hacking on record.\"\n\tLast week, trading and lending platform Mango Market suffered an exploit which happened via an oracle price manipulation attack. In addition, on October 6, popular crypto exchange, Binance confirmed a BNB cross-chain bridge hack with Roughly $100 million of Binance Coin (BNB) stolen due to the exploit.\n",

    "time": "2022-10-25",
    "author": "Blockchain.News Marketing",
    "content": "\tThe first generation of play-to-earn blockchain games has sparked global excitement. But unfortunately, one can't turn a blind eye to their glaring weaknesses and oversights either. For example, building a sustainable game requires a substantial focus on story, artwork, and content rather than monetization. The Monetization Mindset Is Counterproductive\n\tThere is much to like about play-to-earn games and their opportunities. Giving players the ability to own in-game assets and convert them to real money is appealing. Unfortunately, most of these games are also pay-to-lay, as gamers need one or multiple NFTs before they can explore the virtual world. Making an upfront investment - often worth hundreds of dollars - creates a very problematic mindset among players.\n\tRather than enjoying the game to its fullest, players will try to recuperate that initial investment. As such, they will collect in-game rewards and sell them for money as fast as possible. That approach has created unsustainable in-game economies, affecting titles like Axie Infinity. Its native assets, AXS and SLP, are in the dirt and continue to lose value. There isn't sufficient demand for these currencies, and the overall supply keeps growing too quickly.\n\tHowever, developers also won't shy away from taking shortcuts. They often know their players will focus on monetization rather than story or artwork. As a result, they spend less time focusing on those elements and only build game worlds with changing backgrounds, mechanics that grow stale, and repetitive content. In most cases, there is no open \"living\" world to explore, which is not what gaming should be about.\n\tGetting to the market faster than competing games is essential. However, that speedy approach should never compromise storytelling, artwork, or engaging content. P2E Game developers need to rid themselves of the monetization mindset and look beyond how they can make money from players quickly. Building Games Takes Time\n\tVideo games are an art form that combines many different media types, including writing, illustration, and music. As a result, building a video game's narrative and artwork can take an extraordinary amount of time. Moreover, it is a process that shouldn't be rushed, especially not in favor of making a quick buck.\n\tThe writer(s) must first develop an original plot, which can be based on a pre-existing idea from another source. They then must figure out how to make this story fit into the game's world. That process may seem straightforward, but it rarely is. Translating a book or movie to a game - or vice versa - often fails when the project is rushed due to ulterior - and greedy - motives.\n\tOnce the basic plot is established, artists must create concept art for each scene in the game. They must also design characters, scenery, and other elements the team will use in the finished product. Creativity is not a switch one can flip on or off, though. There are days when the muse flows and other days when the creative part of the brain is as barren as a wasteland.\n\tFinally, developers spend several months working on programming code for every game aspect. That code then goes through rigorous testing internally. Most games will also provide alpha and beta testing to the public to ensure everything works as intended. The entire process takes years, from concept to launch of a game, after multiple testing rounds. Any game launching within a few weeks or months from idea to finish will often compromise one or several of these crucial aspects. Not All Blockchain Games Cut Corners\n\tAlthough there are too many P2E titles focused on monetization, other titles succeed in checking the right boxes. Keeping players engaged requires a gamer-first mindset, with monetization taking a backseat. Merging real-life concepts with P2E gaming, as Silks did, shows opportunities are plentiful. In Silks, players participate in a derivative gaming platform focused on thoroughbred horse racing. In-game avatars represent real-world horses born and bred at a facility belonging to the game's creators. NFTs earn in-game rewards based n the horse's real-world performance and training.\n\tAnother example of storytelling and engaging gameplay over monetization is Apeiron. The first god game on the blockchain creates a strong narrative, and the team spent over half a decade creating an enticing game world. In addition, players can perform miracles, control their civilization, explore new planets and stars, and generate new planet NFTs through the Celestial Conjunction mechanic. Whether it is planet simulation, PvE world exploration, or PvP/GvG galactic progression, there is always something to do in the Apeiron ecosystem.\n\tWhen it comes to putting the player first, Plutonians checks the right boxes, too. It is a player-driven game where anyone can create new content: narratives, items, and expansions. Players can share these creations with others without charging them, but they can also sell the content on the marketplace. Putting the player in control of their story - and letting them share the story with others - is an excellent example of gamer empowerment. That is what P2E games should be all about.\n\tCreating a video game is not something one should rush. Major mainstream gaming publishers can develop full-fledged games on a yearly cycle. Even then, they often reuse and rehash most in-game elements from previous versions as there isn't enough time and the monetization mindset takes the upper hand. That is not the path P2E game developers should pursue. The technology is here to build lasting gaming legacies and empower millions of gamers.\n",

    "time": "2019-11-05",
    "author": "Ron Yu",
    "content": "\tAfter some three years of work, Liechtenstein has introduced what some have described as the world’s first blockchain business law (the Lichtenstein Token and Trusted Technologies Law’) which will go into effect in January 2020.\n\tLiechtenstein’s legislation is focused on creating both the legal certainty and framework necessary to conduct blockchain business and the country hopes to use it to distinguish itself from other rivals, such as Malta, Gibraltar, Singapore, Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, who are also courting blockchain companies.\n\tThe new blockchain law’s introduction is important given the growing number of questions raised by blockchain applications related to customer and asset protection as well as the misuse of the technology for money laundering or other criminal purposes.\n\tLiechtenstein’s law contrasts with similar blockchain laws from other countries which are primarily directed at cryptocurrencies. It employs the term “transaction systems based on trustworthy technologies” or TT systems rather than, for example, “blockchain applications”, so as to provide technological independence; that is, the law can work with technologies other than blockchain including future ones.\n\tOne should note that under the new law, a token is a piece of \"information on a TT system\", which digitally \"represents\" rights over claims, memberships, goods or other rights, and which can be assigned to a TT identifier. A token represents a data record consisting of public and private keys and that can be assigned to a user, it is a repository of digital assets. The user can access or do other things (such as dispose of the token) using the keys.\n\tA sharp user would note that this could be a problem if, for example, a TT system provider or a user’s system was hacked. While this is an obvious weakness in the law one should note that someone hacking into your computer to take digital property is analogous to the situation where someone could break into your home and steal your valuables.\n\tAnother thing to be aware of is that tokens, being digital property, are not treated the same way Liechtenstein’s present laws deal with physical property and that the law is limited to TT service providers in Liechtenstein.\n\tWhile imperfect, the new law is nevertheless an important development in the blockchain world and we should congratulate this small nation for taking this first step and hope it can earn some first-mover advantage.\n",

    "content": "\tIt seems like billionaire Mark Cuban has changed his view on cryptocurrencies as he recently revealed that he owns some bitcoins. This comes as a surprise because he was quoted one month ago, saying that he does not hold any crypto.\n\tMark Cuban is the owner of Dallas Mavericks, which plays in the NBA and also a notable investor. Dallas Mavericks in August 2019, announced that it would partner with BitPay and will thus accept Bitcoin for merchandise and tickets.\n\tCuban appeared on The Pomp Podcast, where he was hosted by Anthony Pompliano. It is on this show that he estimated the value of Bitcoins that his team had accumulated since the announcement of the partnership.\n\tTaking about Bitcoin, Cuban is heard saying, “We have put it out for the Mavericks. We did it originally four years ago, but no one bought anything. We have now decided to accept Bitcoin”. He continues, “Go buy everything in Bitcoin. I am okay with that. I think we have brought in $130 worth of Bitcoins, and that is all that I own.”\n\tCuban argues that the dependency of Bitcoin on fiat currency is one of the greatest barriers to its widespread adoption. He argues that at the moment, you have to convert Bitcoin to fiat currency to spend it. In his previous interview with Kevin O’Leary, Cuban pointed out some challenges of cryptocurrencies such as difficulties in spending crypto, widespread understanding, and onboarding challenges as some of the reasons why he does not hold cryptocurrencies.\n\tStatements from investors such as Cuban have, in the past, affected the prices of Bitcoin against fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s price has been on the rise in the past week, which is good news for investors.\n",

    "content": "\tCrypto lender Celsius Network has repaid interest-yielding DeFi service Compound Finance with $10 million worth of the DAI stablecoin, according to a report from Crypto Briefing.\n\tThe payment is likely to be an attempt to re-establish solvency following a recent episode of suspension of withdrawals, swaps and transfers, which resulted in rumours of insolvency. Currently, those services are still under suspension.\n\tCrypto Briefing reported that Celsius has made a number of other repayments over the past week. Celsius has paid $53.6 million DAI in a series of transactions to its vault with Oasis Protocol, a yield-bearing DeFi platform.\n\tAccording to Gemini, DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by Ethereum-based protocol MakerDAO, which seeks to maintain an exact ratio of one-to-one with the US dollar.\n\tCelsius, an Etherscan block explorer, uses DeFi protocols to generate interest for its clients.\n\tAlthough the $10 million payment is only a small fraction of Celsius’ activity, this step is likely a move towards solvency. The payment is also a potential move to close positions with clients to regain liquidity and re-open withdrawals.\n\tCelsius’ repayment comes shortly after the company confirmed through a blog that the suspension of withdrawals, transactions and swaps will continue.\n\t“Our objective continues to be stabilising our liquidity and operations,” the firm wrote on June 19. It added that this “will take time” and that it will “continue to work around the clock.”\n\tCelsius has also stated that it will cooperate with regulators and officials in investigating the company’s suspension of services.\n\tCelsius further confirmed that it would pause Twitter activities and AMAs to prioritise resolving the current situation.\n",

    "content": "\tThe latest report from Citi, titled \"Supply Chain Financing – Building Resilience as the New Definition of 'Global' Emerges,\" offers a comprehensive insight into the evolving landscape of global trade and supply chains. Published on January 22, 2024, this report marks the fourth edition of the Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS) series and stands as a testament to the transformative changes in global trade dynamics.\n\tTransformative Technological Innovations and Resilience\n\tJane Fraser, CEO of Citi, highlights the crucial role of transformative technological innovations in increasing resilience across global supply chains. This focus on resilience is driven by a universal pursuit of security across various domains like food, water, energy, cyber, financial, and operational. The report underscores a significant shift in the reconfiguration of supply chains to meet customer demands and stakeholder expectations. This shift is not only reshaping global trade but is also fostering economic growth.\n\tAdoption of China Plus One Strategy\n\tA notable finding in the report is the adoption of the 'China Plus One' strategy by over half of the global respondents, especially in North America. This strategy involves diversifying supply chains by incorporating an additional sourcing destination alongside China, with Vietnam emerging as the preferred alternative. This trend indicates a conscious effort by companies and nations to diversify their supply chain partners, thereby building new trade corridors and enhancing resilience.\n\tTechnological Developments in Trade Finance\n\tChris Cox, Global Head of Trade and Working Capital Solutions at Citi, emphasizes the central role of technology in trade finance. Innovations like artificial intelligence and blockchain are revolutionizing trade finance by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, mitigating fraud, and improving transparency. These advancements are pivotal in improving access to efficient capital globally, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies in emerging markets.\n\tThe Evolving Nature of Global Supply Chains\n\tThe Citi report delves into the evolution of global supply chains, highlighting the shift towards a new era of diversification. This transformation is evident in various ways:\n\tThe emergence of smaller players in global trade, particularly last-mile suppliers in developing countries.\n\tDiversified economies spurred by increased investments in supply chains, as seen in countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\tThe creation of new trade corridors, exemplified by Brazil’s increased trade with India and China and the Middle East’s stronger connections with Asia.\n\tThe report acknowledges that while significant progress has been made, the transformation of supply chains is a gradual process, requiring time to build new relationships and achieve scale.\n\tChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\n\tDespite the easing of supply chain pressures since the peak in 2021, the report acknowledges ongoing challenges such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. However, these challenges also present opportunities for smaller suppliers to engage more actively in global trade. The report advocates for continued collaboration on global solutions, emphasizing the need for standardization, technological integration, and regulatory harmonization to enhance supply chain resilience.\n",

    "content": "\tBlockFi, a major crypto lending firm based in New Jersey, officially disclosed a total loan of $1.8 billion and a net unsecured exposure of $600 million by the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\tThe bulk of the outstanding loans belonged to institutions, up to $1.5 billion, while retail loans accounted for the remaining $300 million.\n\tThe company said it has guidelines in place to help the current operations of core businesses including institutional and retail lending and trading activities and liquidity of assets.\n\tBlockFi will hold at least 10% of the total amount in inventory according to the customer's demand and refund the customer under this guidance and recover and return to the customer hold at least 50% of the amount owed within 7 days.\n\tWhether it is inventory or loans, BlockFi will recall at least 90% of the total amount owed to customers within a year.\n\tThe company has exposure to Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which has filed for bankruptcy protection. BlockFi's GBTC investment product lost about $80 million due to bad debts from Three Arrows.\n\tTroubled digital asset firm BlockFi has secured a $250 million line of credit from the FTX derivatives exchange as it hopes to survive the current crypto downturn.\n\tWhile BlockFi's woes aren't as evident as Celsius Network or Babel Finance, the company also announced 20% layoffs in June, or about 170 people.\n\tBlockFi CEO Zac Prince said the crypto-lending company will cut “about 20% of its workforce, with layoffs affecting every team in the company. This decision was driven by market conditions that negatively impacted our growth rate and critical scrutiny of our strategic priorities.\"\n\tCurrently, BlockFi has stopped accepting shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as collateral for loans.\n",

    "content": "\tBlockchain research and analytics platform, Messari has raised a total of $21 million from investors in a Series A funding round. The capital raise was led by Steven Cohen’s Point72 Ventures, marking the first time the billionaire will officially be getting involved in the Bitcoin (BTC) and digital currency ecosystem.\n\tAccording to a report by Forbes, Messari has won the hearts of the biggest names in the crypto ecosystem, including Blockchain.com’s Blockchain Ventures, New York-based Gemini’s Gemini Frontier Fund, Wyoming-based Kraken’s Kraken Ventures and Antigua-based FTX’s sister company, Alameda Capital. In addition to these new investors, Messari’s old backers, including Coinbase, also participated in the funding round.\n\tThere is a great affinity towards growth startups in the digital currency world today. This affinity has stirred the accumulation of funds to power firms with a unique business model and the right target market in the blockchain world. While there is often a willingness to fund a promising project, the SEC oversight border on the need to stir transparency amongst startups has largely held many firms bound. However, Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis say the firm has a workaround by being a part of the Big Four and JPMorgan in auditing and analysis provisions.\n\t“The defaults that many entrepreneurs and builders in the industry have is to be transparent and cooperative,” says Selkis, 37. “And try to be as helpful and communicative as possible with their communities. The problem is if you're a core developer or someone that was early in a project, and you're sharing certain sensitive information that even looks like it might be financial in nature. Then the SEC comes knocking on your door. It can create a tremendous amount of headaches.”\n\tThe success story of Messari and its ability to attract such investors as Steven Cohen centres on the firm's due diligence related to building transparency as required by the SEC. Besides Messari, the crypto ecosystem has been seeing several capital fundraisers recently, with NFT Marketplace, MakersPlace amongst those who managed to pull capital from investors.\n",

    "content": "\tResearch estimates about 3.8 million Bitcoin, worth about $30 billion US today has been lost, with most having gone to the grave with crypto holders who failed to tell anyone how to retrieve them.\n\tWhile some experts claim that cryptocurrency is a volatile and risky investment, it continues growing in popularity.\n\tCoincover, a cryptocurrency firm, believes that the answer to this problem is to safeguarding cryptocurrencies beyond the grave.\n\tCryptocurrency wills\n\tCoincover has introduced one of the world’s first cryptocurrency wills to protect cryptocurrency owners when things go wrong.\n\tThe cryptocurrency wills aim to guarantee funds to be fully retrievable by loved ones in case of crypto owners’ death. Coincover CEO, David Janczewski describes this as a solution to the problem facing some people who unexpectedly meet their demise and go to the grave with crypto assets.\n\tDavid mentioned that cryptocurrency is one of the odd things that are incredibly private for a lot of people. If a user acquired his cryptocurrencies early, then he might have a tremendous amount of money though he might be worried about his personal security.\n\tHe said, “Nobody thinks that they are going to die and nobody plans for such eventuality. Therefore, when that occurs, maybe you have not told your loved ones how they should recover it.”\n\tCoincover has a product that gives people an “indestructible” card that has information about their cryptocurrency and others they provide as their beneficiaries.\n\tIf the cryptocurrency holder dies, then their loved ones contact the firm with a unique number on the card, together with a death certificate. The firm then investigates and therefore retrieves the funds.\n\tDeath as a problem\n\tThere have been vast amounts of cryptocurrencies lost when holders died. For example, Gerald Cotton – the CEO OF QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange – died unexpectedly. Gerald was the only person who had passwords to clients’ digital wallets. Unfortunately, more than $135 million in customer funds held in safekeeping was inaccessible forever, locked on the blockchain.\n\tYoung people are drawn to cryptocurrency\n\tToday, a rising number of young people aged 18 to 24 own cryptocurrencies. According to BBC News, Jack Davies, a 23-year-old from Penarth in Wales, UK, is now considering to create a will to ensure his digital assets are passed on to the right people, in case he meets his death unexpectedly.\n\tThis is a good step that other cryptocurrency owners should consider adopting to secure their digital assets after death.\n",

    "title": "Exclusive: What are Top 5 FinTech Career Advice for Graduates?",
    "time": "2019-07-18",
    "author": "Matthew Lam",
    "content": "\tIn Part 1 of the interview, Prof. Aris Stouraitis identified lack of interdisciplinarity is the culprit of FinTech talent shortage in Hong Kong. Interdisciplinarity in FinTech refers to talents that are knowledgeable in both finance and technology. He presents how the Master of Science in Finance (FinTech and Financial Analytics) (“the program”) offered by Hong Kong Baptist University (“HKBU”) strives to nurture interdisciplinary talents, and he provides the top 5 career advice for graduates who wish to work in FinTech and blockchain industry!\n\tWe've noticed that the FinTech program by HKBU has one elective course in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Which area of topics will be covered in this elective course, and what are the learning outcomes?\n\tThe elective course of blockchain and cryptocurrency includes but not limited to the following areas:\n\t1) Foundation of blockchain in both technical and non-technical perspective;\n\t2) Rationale and applications of smart contracts and decentralized autonomous applications;\n\t3) The origin of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n\t4) Various use cases in blockchain applications;\n\t5) Security in blockchain and the importance of cybersecurity.\n\tFor our students, there are four learning outcomes for this elective:\n\t1) The ability to explain and the concept of blockchain and what promises blockchain technology provides;\n\t2) The ability to explain how blockchain technology has transformed different industries;\n\t3) How students can apply the knowledge to address the risks and challenges of businesses adopting blockchain technology;\n\t4) How blockchain technology is applied in the finance industry in the future.\n\tWhat is the practical assessment provided by this program? Because if the program is practical, it will help the graduates a lot in pursuing a career in the blockchain industry.\n\tFirst of all, the program is interdisciplinary. Our teaching staffs come from the finance or computer science field. We have many adjunct professors who are well-known industry practitioners. They tend to have computer science backgrounds.\n\tThere's a lot of interdisciplinarity in the program. Apart from academics, our industry practitioners have a better understanding of the daily blockchain applications and what are the applications and challenges that businesses face. Meanwhile, we are trying to provide internships for our students. They should be able to take an internship while they're studying the program and thus get some practical experience. Therefore, our program is focused on interdisciplinarity and employability. It's a more practical program rather than only abstract theories.\n\tIt's very interesting to know that cybersecurity and privacy is one of the core curriculums of the program. What is the significance of cybersecurity and privacy in fostering FinTech development?\n\tI think that cybersecurity and privacy are the core of FinTech and any IT applications.\n\tCybersecurity is going to be critical in FinTech. Take mobile banking as an example. If you are using mobile banking, you want to make sure that the transactions are secure. The demand for cybersecurity will increase when there is more online transactions in the future.\n\tFor privacy, it becomes increasingly important when corporates like Facebook access to a large amount of user’s data. How Facebook is going to use the data becomes the critical privacy issue for users. I think cybersecurity and privacy are gaining attention, and no one was paying too much attention to privacy before. Both governments and individuals start looking at privacy much more seriously.\n\tThere are more universities launching their FinTech program since 2018. How do you evaluate the program in HKBU against others like HKUST?\n\tThe universities in Hong Kong are setting up FinTech programs independently. I think in future, there may be more convergence of FinTech programs, or some universities may look for a particular niche within FinTech.\n\tOur program focuses more on employability. We think that the majority of our graduates want to find a job after graduation instead of studying for a Ph.D. It's both practical and theoretical as we have academics from the interdisciplinary background and industry practitioners in the program. Some of our courses provide internships for our students to gain practical experience. The core focuses are employability and practical applications.\n\tWe know FinTech is a fast-changing domain. How does the program keep up with the fast-changing pace in the industry?\n\tOur programs will be updated continuously in the future.\n\tThis is very important because, with a traditional program like corporate finance, you set up the program, and then the structure remains unchanged for the next 15 years.\n\tThis is not the case for FinTech. There is a need for these programs to be updated continuously. We just launch the program now, and I expect that we will update the program on an annual basis. With the fast-changing pace in FinTech, we need to review the curriculum, course offerings, and structure regularly.\n\tWe also keep abreast of FinTech development from our industry practitioners. We attend a lot of industry meetings and the practitioners are well aware of FinTech development. They also provide valuable feedback for us to update the program continuously.\n\tWhat is your career advice to graduates who wish to work in the blockchain industry or FinTech?\n\tThe opportunities in FinTech are going to be very exciting. For instance, we will have new virtual banks in Hong Kong, and they are looking for talents in this area. I have the top 5 career advice for graduates:\n\t1) Pay attention to interdisciplinarity\n\tWe need to be able to understand both the technical and financial sides. If you understand only one of the two, you will not be as competent as the others.\n\t2) Keep abreast of changes in regulation and compliance\n\tCompliance is very important in the banking industry nowadays. All FinTech applications will have to comply with regulations. I think graduates need to be well aware of the regulations in their field of FinTech and how things are changing.\n\t3) Learn more on cybersecurity and privacy\n\tI predict there will be surging demand on cybersecurity talents going forward. You need to keep abreast of the knowledge in cybersecurity and privacy.\n\t4) Beware of ethical considerations\n\tI believe that new FinTech applications are presenting ethical considerations which are not well understood currently. However, ethical considerations will be more important in the future. Let’s say we develop algorithms on algorithmic trading. For me, I don't purchase tobacco stocks because I think it's unethical. Do you train your algorithms not to purchase tobacco stocks or not to trade in a particular industry?\n\t5) Open to entrepreneurial opportunities\n\tIn the past, graduates worked in investment banks after their studies. With Fintech, people can develop their own applications and start their own companies! Be open to such opportunities and get prepared!\n",

    "content": "\tSINGAPORE - On 18th May 2020, Matrixport will introduce the Fixed Income Investment Product and the Flexi-Term Investment product, where asset security is protected by a risk control mechanism by real crypto assets guaranteed by excess pledge.\n\tMatrixport is launching two new additions to their assortment of cryptocurrency asset management products and services, the Fixed Income Investment product and the Flexi-Term Investment product. For both products, real crypto assets are guaranteed by excess pledge and the product itself is designed to have ensured asset security by institutional-grade custody and a rigorous risk control mechanism, while offering its users high returns with stability and liquidity.\n\tThe Fixed Income Investment product is a digital assets-based wealth management product derived through creditor’s rights assignment. USD stablecoin holders who use this product can benefit from a 7 to 8% fixed annualized return. In addition, users have the ability to either hold their investment until it reaches its maturity or opt to assign the loan assets to other creditors at a subsequently lower price before the loans date of expiry. This means that investments can be cashed ahead of schedule in the presence of other potential creditors.\n\tThe Flexi-Term Investment Product, on the other hand, aims to serve as an alternative to a fiat saving account in a low to negative interest environment. It allows for more flexibility in their high-yield low-risk category with an early exit option. Compared to dollar deposits, early redemption still offers a higher interest rate. With this product, users can hold until the product reaches its maturity and receive the fixed income, or in this instance users have the option to choose early redemption and recover the principal and potentially part of the income.\n\tBoth products feature a risk control mechanism for asset losses incurred by falling prices or borrowers insolvency. Other than this, these products are built on the premise of full transparency by offering a pay-off calculation that is visible to investors, which allows them to receive their returns in either the currency they used for the contract or a stablecoin such as USDC. This is all backed by Institutional level custody services that guarantee asset protection and safety throughout the process.\n\tFor more information, please visit the official website: https://www.matrixport.com/\n\tAbout Matrixport\n\tFounded in February 2019, Matrixport is the gateway to the digital economy where you can trade, custody, invest and borrow crypto assets all in one stop. With rich industry resources and leading technology capabilities, Matrixport aims to create the next generation digital financial service platform. Our vision is to enable a more open and equal financial system using blockchain technologies.\n\tWebsite|Telegram|Medium|Twitter\n",

    "content": "\tOne U.S. money manager is looking to tap into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - one of the hot trends on the blockchain - as approval for a conventional cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) is still nowhere in sight.\n\tDefiance ETFs’ Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (ticker NFTZ) is launching on Thursday and will track blockchain-related firms and the NFT index.\n\tThe company will not invest in any cryptocurrencies directly, but it is one of the first ETFs to tap the booming market for NFTs.\n\tThe gauge will track firms that have exposure to the crypto industry.\n\tThe closest regulators have come to approving a fund that invests in cryptocurrencies was when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed an ETF that holds Bitcoin futures to begin trading in October.\n\tBlockchain thematic ETFs have proliferated while the SEC rejected numerous applications for a spot ETF over the last several years.\n\tSylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer for Defiance ETFs, said that the NFTZ fund “is a great way for investors to gain access to not only the fast-growth blockchain technology aspect of the digital world but companies involved in the renaissance of NFTs”.\n\tThe fund carries a management fee of 0.65%, meaning $6.50 for every $1,000 invested. Its top positions are in Silvergate Capital Corp, Cloudflare, Inc, Bitfarms Ltd, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc, Hut 8 Mining Corp, and Coinbase Global Inc.\n\tAlthough NFTs were introduced a few years ago, they really caught fire this year amid a wider boom in crypto markets.\n\tNFTs allow holders of art, collectables and just about any other asset to track ownership.\n\tAccording to nonfungible.com, the company website listed roughly 766,000 sales over the past month, with some $1.8 billion spent overall.\n\t“NFTs today are what Bitcoin was 10 years ago, except that there is a robust community made up of creators and investors who co-exist to determine the future path of a non-fungible token,” said Jablonski.\n",

    "content": "\tThe crypto industry in Nepal is about to witness further setbacks as the government has started to ban trading mediums for digital assets.\n\tAccording to a report by NepalPress, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) is shutting down all mobile apps and websites that engage in trading cryptocurrency trading in the country.\n\tThe report said that this action is being taken to stop the remittance of capital to foreign banks by converting them into cryptocurrency.\n\tThe NTA started taking action after the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology ordered national internet providers to ban websites and platforms that engage in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\tSurya Prasad Lamichhane, deputy director at the NTA, confirmed the authority’s action saying that “the government has directed to close the apps after carrying out an investigation.”\n\tThe Nepalese government has pointed towards crypto trading as a major reason behind rising economic-related crimes and a potential instigator of financial instability.\n\tIn January, the Nepal Rastra Bank released a directive banning any form of investment or transactions in cryptocurrency or hyper funds. It stated that the action was being taken to fight fraud and illegal outflow of domestic capital.\n\tThe bank also announced that any Nepali or foreigner living in Nepal and Nepalis abroad is liable to prosecution or further investigation if they are found to be dabbling in virtual currencies.\n\tNepal Bankers’ Association, the umbrella organisation of commercial banks, shares a similar sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.\n\tThe association said that virtual currency and network marketing business and transactions are illegal in Nepal.\n\tHowever, despite warnings, Nepalis have not backed away from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to local media. A report from Nepali Trends said that “cryptocurrency can be the future currency in the world… So, there is a huge suspect that some people are still transacting bitcoin.”\n\t“It seems that Nepalese are investing in several ways. Some reports show that people are taking help from relatives and friends living abroad to invest in cryptocurrencies,” the publication added.\n\tHowever, crypto investments continue to remain largely unseen as the government lacks technological tools to track and regulate such transactions, the Nepali Trends report stated.\n",

    "content": "\tChina’s Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced its development plans for outlining a blockchain-based trade finance platform for the so-called Greater Bay Area that links Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Macao.\n\tGoverning entities in China, including the PBoC, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the Foreign Exchange Bureau came together to issue the official document for the proposal. The entities submitted their suggestions on financing the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, focusing on global trade and finance.\n\tThe proposed blockchain-based platform would enable participating banks to securely share cross-border trading information through a reliable source. Blockchain technology was considered, as its decentralized feature that removes the need for third-party intervention when information is traded between members, enabling higher security.\n\tThe report also mentioned the support of innovative technologies including blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the Greater Bay Area. The central bank’s report added that the new financial technology (FinTech) developments would also include facilitating more efficient electronic payments in Renminbi in Mainland China. Non-banking financial institutions will be supported for their expansion plans in Hong Kong and Macao.\n\tPBoC official urges the acceleration of digitization of the Chinese economy with blockchain\n\tChina’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) Financial Technology Committee held its first meeting of the year this week, after months of delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\tFan Yifei, the PBoC’s deputy governor echoed President Xi Jinping’s call for the acceleration of the country’s blockchain development adoption. The president pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen fundamental research of blockchain technology and enhance innovation, enabling China to take a leading position in the blockchain field.\n\tThe bank’s deputy governor met with the central bank’s officials as well as the heads of their affiliated financial institutions. Fan emphasized the importance of blockchain and financial technology (FinTech) industries and wanted to ensure China’s adoption plan would be laid out and implemented by 2021 to be in line with the deadline they have set out.\n\tNew policies were also discussed along with an overview of scientific studies to encourage the development plan, as Fan further stressed the urgency for accelerating the digitization of the Chinese economy.\n\tChina Construction Bank’s updates of blockchain platform after $50B transacted\n\tOne of China’s four largest banks, China Construction Bank (CCB) has officially released the second version of its blockchain platform for trade finance, reaching 360 billion yuan ($50 billion) in cumulative transaction volume.\n\tCCB announced the release of “BCTrade 2.0,” focusing on digitizing trade and financial services between 54 domestic and overseas CCB branches and 40 external organizations. Reported by Xinhua news, these organizations include state-owned banks and foreign banks.\n\tStarting in 2017, CCB’s project claimed to be the first to use blockchain for domestic letters of credit, forfaiting and international factoring. In March this year, CCB announced that the blockchain was responsible for the 200 billion yuan transacted in 2018 with 40 domestic and financial participants involved.\n\tThe platform allows trading and financing activities, including accounts receivable and trade financing. Aiming to provide a regulatory system for trade finance and to enable real-time monitoring of financial activities, the second version of the blockchain was publicly announced after having reached 360 billion yuan in transaction volume. Ji Zhihong, the Vice President of CCB said that the “distributed storage, transaction traceability, and non-tamperability\" characteristics of blockchain are highly compatible with trade finance.\n",

    "time": "2023-08-06",
    "author": "Jessie A Ellis",
    "content": "\tIn a recent meeting, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission has emphasized the need for a systematic, legal, and source-based approach to combat overseas telecom network fraud and related criminal activities. The announcement was made on August 6, 2023, as reported by the Economic Daily.\n\tThe commission pointed out that fraud groups have been increasingly utilizing new technologies such as blockchain, metaverse, virtual currency, and AI intelligence to update their criminal tools, making them more concealed and deceptive.\n\tOverseas Telecom Fraud: A Growing Concern\n\tIn recent years, overseas telecom network fraud groups have been luring ordinary people into fraudulent activities under the guise of \"high-paying job recruitment.\" These activities have led to violent detention, human trafficking, and a series of dark industrial chains, causing significant harm to the safety of people's lives and property.\n\tThe diversity of fraudulent methods, the ruthlessness of coercion, and the enormity of the defrauded amounts have led to public outrage. The commission stressed the need to \"resolutely maintain the people's vital interests, firmly uphold social decency, and firmly uphold the authority of the rule of law.\"\n\tOrganized Crime Features\n\tThe overseas telecom network fraud groups are characterized by tight organization, clear division of labor, multi-industry support, industrial distribution, group operation, and refined division of labor. This has necessitated strengthening international law enforcement cooperation and joint efforts with relevant countries to eradicate fraud dens, rescue trapped individuals, and bring the criminal forces and their organizers to justice.\n\tUtilizing New Technologies for Fraud\n\tThe commission noted that fraud groups are leveraging blockchain, metaverse, virtual currency, and AI intelligence to constantly update their criminal tools, making them more concealed and confusing. This requires coordination between public security, finance, telecommunications, and internet departments to apply advanced technological means and fulfill regulatory responsibilities.\n\tEfforts are being made to compress online crime space from offline, organize concentrated investigations and disposals of high-risk telephone cards and bank cards related to fraud, clean up associated internet accounts, and smooth network reporting channels. Thorough investigations are being conducted into domestic criminal gangs colluding with overseas entities, with full efforts to cut off smuggling channels.\n\tThere are increasing crimes related to crypto, blockchain, NFT and Metaverse in China.\n\tOn July 18, 2023, Chinese authorities in Qingshui County, Shanxi Province, successfully cracked a money laundering case involving the cryptocurrency Tether (USDT). The operation led to the arrest of 21 suspects and the confiscation of cash and USDT worth over 1 million yuan.\n\tThe investigation revealed a complex network of individuals across four provinces and six cities, using USDT to launder money for cybercriminals. The criminal group helped settle payments of over 54.8 million USDT, equivalent to about 380 million yuan.\n\tIn December 2022 in Inner Mongolia, 63 suspects were arrested for laundering money with USDT, amounting to 12 billion yuan.\n\tPublic Awareness and Education\n\tThe public security and judicial departments are urged to further strengthen publicity and education to continuously enhance people's awareness and ability to identify and prevent telecom network fraud. Special attention is being paid to young people entering society, guiding them to be vigilant against opportunistic psychology and herd mentality, and to seek a solid footing in serving society.\n",

    "content": "\tRobinhood Markets Inc’s shares tumbled 15% in after-hours trade as the commission-free brokerage firm saw a $423 million net loss in the last quarter.\n\tRobinhood said it lost $0.49 per share in the three months that ended in December. While a year before its initial public offering (IPO), Robinhood’s net income was $7 million or $0.01 per share.\n\tAccording to Reuters, shares of Robinhood sank as much as 15% to $9.98 in extended trading following results. The share price at its IPO in July last year was $38, and its record high in August was $85.\n\tRobinhood saw an increase in its third set results as a public company with $363 million for the fourth quarter in December 2021, compared to $318 million in 2020.\n\tHowever, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, the expected revenue was $362.14 million.\n\tIn accordance with Reuters, the factor contributing to Robinhood’s net loss was the 162% increase in costs during the fourth quarter from the previous year.\n\tRobinhood Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick attributed much of the costs to share-based compensation and increasing headcount.\n\t“We think we’re in a really good position to start slowing that from here,” he said.\n\tTransaction-based revenue from digital currencies jumped 304% to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, while revenue from equity trading declined 35% to $52 million, Reuters reported.\n\tSimilar to other start-ups, Robinhood has yet to make a profit following its IPO and even though the company’s revenue showed a positive sign, their monthly active users fell 8% from the previous quarter of 17.3 million.\n\tAmong other latest updates, Robinhood’s crypto wallet officially went live on January 21, Blockchain.News reported. In doing so, the company has allowed the first 1,000 users to make crypto withdrawals.\n\tBlockchain.News also added that the first 1,000 people on the waiting list to sign up for a “wallet” can participate in this beta test and can exchange their cryptocurrency from Robinhood with an external crypto wallet.\n\tRobinhood said that it plans to expand to 10,000 in March, although the number of participants is capped at this stage.

    "content": "\tThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed its first lawsuit against a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\n\tThe holders of governance tokens have also been sued alongside the accused DAO.\n\tAs part of the lawsuit, a $250,000 penalty and settlement have to be settled by bZeroX, LLC and its founders - Kyle Kistner and Tom Bean.\n\tThe bZx protocol gained popularity in 2020 after suffering code exploits. It resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars with crypto.\n\tAccording to The Block, the CFTC's action, including filing a lawsuit against Ooki DAO, could have a broader impact than a lawsuit against the DAO. Ooki DAO in 2021 was used to govern the protocol as part of a decentralization effort.\n\tThe suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\tThe CFTC accused Ooki DAO of using its structure to evade regulatory oversight in its complaint.\n\t\"A key bZeroX objective in transferring control of the bZx Protocol (now the Ooki Protocol) to the bZx DAO (now the Ooki DAO) was to attempt to render the bZx DAO, by its decentralized nature, enforcement-proof. Put simply, the bZx founders believed they had identified a way to violate the Act and Regulations, as well as other laws, without consequence,\" the CFTC said.\n\tThis move by the CFTC also proves that DAOs are not immune \"from enforcement\".\n\t\"The bZx founders were wrong, however,\" the agency stressed. \"DAOs are not immune from enforcement and may not violate the law with impunity.\"\n\tAccording to the lawsuit, Ooki DAO has been identified by the CFTC as \"an unincorporated association comprised of holders of Ooki Tokens.\" They are liable in the suit.\n",

The announcement confirmed in a Twitter post, will see Ghostcoin’s adoption and integration by 60 vending machines in Hong Kong including those at Disneyland.\n\tGhostcoins Launching and Giant Leaps\n\tGhostcoin was launched last week disregarding the controversies surrounding it. The privacy coin is the invention of John McAfee, a British American Inventor famous for the game-changing anti-virus software McAfee. Ghost coin has unique features that further the fundamental agenda of blockchain technology which includes providing complete anonymity when making transactions. Ghost transactions use a state of the art escrow pool to shield and erase the history of transactions. GHOST transactions are verified using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\tThe super-privacy coin runs on a decentralized system that uses a proof-of-stake network controlled by GHOST token holders and users. GHOST has no central company or owner and is run and maintained by the community. The unique features of Ghost have attracted businesses in the UAE and Hong Kong where payment startups ZelaaPayAE and iVendPay are helping to drive its integration by vendors.\n\tHigher Expectations\n\tMcAfee’s Ghostcoin has gained a lot of attention from the cryptocurrency sector since the announcement of its impending launch. While it may be too early to rate the coin’s users' experience, blockchain enthusiasts' reaction to the series of strides the coin has made is impressive. In keeping up with future expectations, the project will need to amply introduce more value while creating bigger markets across countries. In all, the blockchain ecosystem stands as a winner with this new addition to the family.\n",

    "time": "2024-03-19",
    "author": "Rebeca Moen",
    "content": "\tThe former Chief Executive Officer of Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has teased the launch of a new project deeply rooted in educational efforts surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This news comes as the industry increasingly recognizes the importance of informed participation and knowledge-sharing in fostering a sustainable and inclusive digital economy.\n\tChangpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, has indicated that this initiative will starkly contrast with many other cryptocurrency projects, by specifically excluding the creation or involvement of a new token. This approach aims to distance the endeavor from the financial speculation that often accompanies token launches, centering the project's focus on education and widespread blockchain literacy.\n\tWhile details remain scant at this stage, the announcement has already sparked interest across the crypto community, with stakeholders eager to understand the scope, nature, and potential impact of Zhao's educational project. With a promise of more information to come, there is speculation that the initiative could encompass a variety of formats, from online courses and workshops to educational materials and community outreach programs.\n\tGiven Zhao's prominence in the industry and Binance's expansive user base, this initiative has the potential to make significant strides in cryptocurrency education. The lack of a token offering also suggests a commitment to providing public goods without immediate commercial incentives, a move that could help bolster the credibility and altruistic perception of the project.\n\tIn the context of the broader crypto ecosystem, education has been pinpointed as a crucial factor in driving adoption and fostering a safer investment environment. Amidst regulatory scrutiny and a history of high-profile scams and misinformation, clear and accessible educational resources could play a critical role in mitigating risks for new entrants and empowering users with the knowledge to navigate the complex landscape of digital assets.\n\tAs the industry awaits further details of Zhao's educational project, this announcement aligns with a broader trend of crypto platforms investing in educational initiatives. Major exchanges like Coinbase and platforms like Ethereum have also dedicated resources to improving blockchain literacy, underscoring the collective understanding that education is key to the sector's long-term success and public acceptance.\n\tDespite Zhao's departure from the executive role at Binance, his continued influence and commitment to the cryptocurrency community remain evident through this new venture. The project's forthcoming details will be closely watched by enthusiasts, industry players, and educational institutions alike, as they anticipate the potential contributions to a more knowledgeable and informed digital asset space.\n",

    "content": "\tHamilton Lane, a global private markets investment firm, formed a partnership deal with digital asset securities firm Securitize to tokenize three of its investment funds on Wednesday.\n\tThrough the partnership, funds to be tokenized include unlisted equities, private credit, and secondary transactions.\n\tHamilton Lane, which has $835 billion in assets under management, plans to give qualified U.S.-based investors access to funds through providing exposure to direct equities, private credit, and secondary transactions, which will be tokenized via Securitize's blockchain-based digital transfer agency.\n\tHamilton's tokenized funds are expected to be available by the fourth quarter, enabling a broader investor base to access the funds. Customers will still need to be accredited, which means those with a net worth of more than $1 million or income above $200,000.\n\tVictor Jung, Head of Digital Assets at Hamilton Lane, commented about the development: \"This collaboration with Securitize is our latest step toward enabling access to the strong returns and performance opportunities generated within the private markets space for a newer set of investors while increasing usability and transparency through the use of blockchain technology.\"\n\tThe new tokenized funds highlight Hamilton's commitment to expanding ease of access to the private markets through the use of blockchain technology. Private-equity investments are generally accessible only to institutional investors or ultra-high-net-worth investors. But blockchain has opened up the access of private-market strategies to retail investors.\n\tTherefore, converting funds into security tokens enables individual investors to place money in assets previously only accessible to institutions. It reduces issuance and administration costs and enables fractional ownership.\n\tHamilton Lane's move follows the announcement last month when KKR tapped blockchain technology further to open its private equity strategy to individual investors. The developments signal a series of asset management firms using intermediaries to expand access to funds to high net-worth individuals and accredited investors.\n\tOther asset managers, like Partners Group, Investcorp, and Temasek-backed Mapletree, also tokenized their funds recently, as they know that individual investors will increasingly drive their growth investments.\n",

    "content": "\tArgo Blockchain plc, a publicly traded cryptocurrency mining firm based in the UK, on Friday, announced its operational update for July 2022.\n\tDuring the month of July, Argo revealed that it mined 219 Bitcoins as compared to 179 BTCs in June 2022.\n\tThe company further said its mining revenue in July amounted to £3.89 million [$4.73 million] compared to June's £3.38 million ($4.35 million).\n\tAs of 31 July 2022, Argo said it held 1295 Bitcoins, out of which BTC Equivalents were 227.\n\tMining Hardware Machines Update\n\tDuring the month of July, Argo stated that it completed its machine swap of about 10,000 S19s Antminers, which were hosted with Core Scientific, and finalized its strategic pivot to a self-hosted business model.\n\tAs a result of the completion of its machine swap, Argo said it now expects to generate better performance from its mining machines and have greater control of operations, including operational expenses.\n\tApart from that, Argo mentioned that in July it faced operational challenges with its 17 series machines. The company, therefore, conducted a comprehensive review of its entire mining fleet, with a focus on its S17 and T17 miners (collectively, the \"17 series machines\").\n\tAs a result, Argo identified that it was not the only miner affected by the hitches associated with its 17 series machines. There were also high failures among the 17 series machines in other crypto mining firms in the sector.\n\tDespite Argo removing the non-operational 17 series machines, its total hashrate at the end of July was around 2.23EH/s. This figure took into account the company’s continued installation of the S19J Pros ordered from Bitmain and the completion of the Core machine swap.\n\tPeter Wall, Argo's CEO, talked about the development: \"We would like to thank Core Scientific for acting as an invaluable and reliable business partner in this transition period which represents a crucial step for Argo's future development. The completion of the S19 machine's swap marks a further consolidation of our infrastructure, allowing us to retain further control of our operations and adjust them in accordance with our needs at any given time. While there have been some challenges in operating the 17 series machines, we are pleased with the ROI we have achieved on this portion of our mining infrastructure.\"\n\tFinancing Deal\n\tMoreover, during the month of July, Argo said it sold 887 Bitcoins at an average price of around $22,670. The firm said it used the proceeds to reduce obligations under a BTC-backed loan agreement with Galaxy Digital and to fund operating expenses and growth capital.\n\tAs of 31 July 2022, Argo mentioned it had an outstanding balance of $6.72 million under the BTC-backed loan, a huge reduction from the maximum outstanding balance of $50 million in Q2 2022.\n\tHelios Power Activities\n\tDuring the month of July, Argo's electricity costs at its Helios facility in Texas continued to rise higher than anticipated in the past. Electricity costs have increased around the world, mainly because of higher natural gas prices stemming from the war in Ukraine, as well as increased demand for electric-powered air conditioning during an unusually hot and dry summer.\n\tIn the middle of July, Argo said ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc) – a US organization that operates Texas's electrical grid –issued a conservation alert urging all residential, commercial, and industrial electricity users to reduce electricity consumption during specific afternoon hours when electricity demands were at its highest.\n\tAs a result, Argo and major large-scale Bitcoin miners in Texas, proactively shut down their mining operations and reduced usage by over 1,000 MW, thereby reducing strain on the grid during peak demand.\n",

The island is categorized under South Korea’s special self-governing zones.\n\tThe blockchain-based management system will track the history of receipts of waste-batteries acquired at the Jeju Technopark Electric Vehicle Battery Industrialization Center opened in June 2019. The information obtained will include details about various releases, classifications, and inspections based on records found on the blockchain.\n\tBlockchain in the electric vehicle industry\n\tThe electric vehicle sector is experiencing considerable growth because of benefits, such as reduced fuel costs and lower car emissions. As a result, electric vehicles are offering environmentally friendly solutions based on decreased carbon pollution.\n\tThe blockchain-propelled management system intended for the distribution history of electric vehicle batteries was established in December 2019 after receiving a $1 million grant from LG CNS, a subsidiary of LG Corporation offering IT services. It emerged the best among 12 projects, and the Korean government has vowed to support it with a $580,000 grant, as well as a private support matching program.\n\tThis pilot project won the hearts of government officials based on its capability of propelling the development of the electric vehicle industry. It is expected to boost the distribution market of energy storage devices (ESS), such as EV batteries, as well as offering the basis for the standardization of battery performance evaluation attributes.\n\tThe future strategy director of Jeju Island, Heesop Roh, noted, “Recent national security improvements can be attributed to the 4th industrial revolution and the achievements that Jeju Island has made even within budgetary constraints.”\n\tThrough a government pledge of approximately $410 million, the Ministry of Science and ICT is planning a large blockchain R&D project to determine the feasibility of blockchain technology research through 2025.\n\tIn 2020, a nation-wide selection of 10 projects will be made to be part of the blockchain-powered electric vehicle waste-battery distribution management program based on its prolonged implementation.\n",

In addition to being a blockchain believer, it is no secret that Dorsey is a huge Bitcoin advocate as well, having proclaimed in the past that BTC may potentially be the world’s main and only currency by 2030.\n\tNow, Dorsey has once again backed his views on the “digital gold” cryptocurrency. He explained:\n\t“The whole spirit of Bitcoin is to provide a trusted system in a distrusted environment, which is the internet.”\n\tAccording to the Twitter CEO, Bitcoin is the best digital currency that has been created up to now, and it has the same patterns as the internet – it is consensus-driven and is also controlled by the public versus a centralized order. Speaking to Thor Halvorssen, Dorsey said:\n\t“Blockchain and Bitcoin point to a future, and point to a world, where content exists forever, where it’s permanent, doesn’t go away and exists forever on every single node that’s connected to it.”\n\tTwitter to become blockchain-based?\n\tDorsey disclosed that Twitter was moving towards an open-source social media protocol, with his non-profit initiative Blue Sky working towards establishing one, as shared by Forbes. In the future, Dorsey hopes that Twitter can be a client of Blue Sky, as they are separate entities.\n\tThe CEO said in regards to Twitter, “We’re not in the content hosting business anymore, we’re in the discovery business.”\n\tDorsey disclosed that security could never be fully perfected and “that it was a constant race.” However, he said, “The more we’re giving the individual the keys, the safer we’re going to be.”\n\tThe Twitter CEO hopes that his company will move towards that, and he says that Bitcoin and blockchain have fundamentally already achieved this.\n",

This cooperation will expand the Helium node and deploy their own Helium 5G CBRS-based hotspots with dish customers while receiving HNT token rewards.\n\tHelium network, founded in 2013, is the world's first peer-to-peer LoRaWAN wireless IoT network, also known as “The People's Network”.\n\tFrank Mong, Chief Operating Officer of Helium, commented on the collaboration:\n\t\"Dish understands the potential blockchain can have on the wireless industry, and as the first major carrier to join The People's Network, this partnership is real validation that the HNT incentive model is a powerful tool for deploying infrastructure at scale.\"\n\tEarlier, Helium 5G was approved by the community to provide connections for high-bandwidth devices such as mobile phones. FreedomFi predicts that Helium 5G can span more than 40,000 small cells by the end of 2022, making it larger than many small cell networks to date.\n\tMore and more network providers and operators or IoT companies, including Volvo and Cisco, hope to expand 5G roaming services for their customers on the Helium network.\n\tThe HNT token surged 42.2% to a daily high of $23.50 on October 26. According to Coinmarketcap, the HNT token was up 13.26% in the past 24 hours, At the time of writing, HNT was trading at $24.56.\n\tAs reported by Blockchain.News on August 11, The Helium Network, supported by Andreessen Horowitz, raised $111 million through the sale of its native token (HNT).\n",

    "content": "\tAn impending agreement between the blockchain scaling technology firm StarkWare and Chainlink Labs will result in the addition of Oracle services, data feeds, and price feeds to the StarkNet ecosystem. This relationship will be established in the near future.\n\tBecause of the relationship, StarkWare will take part in Chainlink's Scale programme, and the price feeds for StarkNet's testnet will come from Chainlink. In addition, StarkNet tokens will be used to fund some operating expenditures for Chainlink oracle nodes. This access to Chainlink oracle services and data feeds will be provided to Starket developers via the usage of StarkNet tokens.\n\tChainlink is a decentralised oracle network that enables smart contracts to access off-chain data sources, application programming interfaces (APIs), and payment systems in a secure manner. It makes it possible for smart contracts to interact with data and events that take place in the real world, which in turn makes it possible for them to be triggered by data that originates from outside sources.\n\tThe network makes use of decentralised nodes, which are entrusted with the responsibility of delivering smart contracts with data that can be relied on and is secure. In exchange, these nodes are rewarded with payments in Chainlink's native LINK currency. The data that is supplied to smart contracts by node operators has been checked and calculated by those node operators before being submitted to smart contracts. This verifies that the information is accurate and may be relied upon.\n\tAccording to a statement that was released by StarWare, an economically feasible framework has been built between StarkNet and Chainlink. It is also hoped that the integration would provide developers working on StarkNet with the basic infrastructure needed to build \"highly performant, more sophisticated, and secure smart contract applications.\"\n\tOracles are an important part of the system, and their value can be seen in a wide range of applications because to the flexibility they provide. Knowledge about the current value of assets or NFTs is required for a significant number of applications. Oracles are often compared to extensive toolkits due to their breadth of functionality.\n",

This has instigated a centralized system where customers' options are limited, prompting substandard holiday rental experience and dwindling profit margins for hosts.\n\tEzyStayz seeks to revamp this through blockchain as customers are presented with a multitude of peer-to-peer services absent in the present home rental market. The blockchain network adopted also uses a safe multi-signature digital wallet able to store various cryptocurrencies, and this makes instant payments inevitable.\n\tEzyStayz seeks a cheaper and transparent system\n\tEzyStayz has had the objective of incorporating technological innovations into its future operations. Part of the solutions has seen it incorporate blockchain into its services as this is deemed to optimize customer loyalty by offering them a safer, cheaper, and transparent avenue of planning vacations and travel holidays.\n\tEzyStayz is also leveraging on blockchain to create digital identities for its user base as this will be instrumental in eradicating intermediaries as customers can finish transactions through smart contracts and communicate directly.\n",

    "author": "Nicholas Otieno",
    "content": "\tThe Helium Foundation on Thursday announced the migration of its decentralized wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network, the Helium Network, to the Solana blockchain. The foundation approved the decision after a successful community vote on the proposal.\n\tSince its establishment in 2013, the Helium network has been operating on its own blockchain, known as HIP 70.\n\tOn Thursday, the foundation disclosed that a majority community vote of 81.41% approved the Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP 70) aimed at developing the network to meet user demand. The proposal requirements demanded participants to stake the Helium native token (HNT) in order to engage in the voting exercise.\n\tAccording to the final results, 6,177 members voted in favour of the migration by staking some 12 million HNT ($57 million) versus 1,270 members who voted against the proposal.\n\tThe Helium Foundation stated that the transition will allow HNT to become more compatible with other projects and crypto applications in non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other Web3 applications.\n\tHelium Foundation COO Scott Sigel said: “Solana has a proven track record powering some of the world’s most important decentralized initiatives, and they were an obvious choice for us to partner with. Moving to the Solana blockchain allows us to focus our efforts on scaling the network as opposed to managing the blockchain itself.”\n\tChallenges to be Fixed\n\tThe proposal comes after the Helium core developer team recently called for the need to fix various technical issues to improve the network’s capabilities. Last month, the developers acknowledged that there have been challenges facing network participants with much reduced Proof-of-Coverage activity because of network size, blockchain/validator load, and packet delivery issues.\n\tTheir announcement came after node hotspot operators in the Helium subreddit in July posted about the dwindling rewards made from their efforts, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of investment into Helium.\n\tSuch criticisms of the Helium blockchain project stirred a strong debate over the company's long-term prospects.\n\tAs a result, the Helium developers made the proposal, dubbed HIP 70, on August 31. They forwarded the HIP 70 proposal to improve data transfer and network coverage abilities. They said the move is aimed to “bring significant economies of scale through the vast range of composable Solana developer tools, features, and applications.”\n\tThey said the move aims to scale Helium to meet the demands of builders and users as part of efforts to accelerate the decentralized wireless network of Helium 5G and over 945,000 Internet of Things (IoT) user-managed hotspot devices across the world.\n\tAccording to the Helium Foundation, the migration will see Helium’s ecosystem tokens, including HNT, IOT and MOBILE tokens and Data Credits (DCs), soon be issued on Solana. Once the migration is completed, Helium will roll out a new version of the Helium Wallet App to be available for users, the foundation said.\n\tThe news comes after Nova Labs, the company behind the Helium network, on Tuesday formed a five-year deal with T-Mobile’s 5G services to embark on filling the gaps in Helium’s coverage. Blockchain.News reported the matter.\n\tHelium is an open-source blockchain network designed to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices with wireless connectivity. Founded in 2013, the decentralized wireless network has grown to become a huge continuous wireless network across the globe. Helium has a presence in 65,000 cities and 170 countries, focusing on serving the Internet of Things (IoT) around the world.\n",

The JD Chain blockchain framework was made open sourced around a year ago, five months after the company launched the JD Blockchain Open Platform enabling companies to use JD’s platform using pre-built APIs. The blockchain protocol has been opened up to allow enterprises to built custom solutions.\n\tThe two enterprise-level blockchain applications have been applied to industries such as supply chain, human resources, leasing, and around ten other industries. The blockchain smart contracts have been used for over 1 million transactions involving contracts, and the company expects the number to grow to hundreds of millions in the near future.\n\tThe JD.com blockchain-based smart contract platform offers a one-stop service for high flexibility in signature management, framework management, contract management, contract framework, and online judicial services. The platform aims to cover most online business scenarios involving contracts and to offer governments and enterprises to be able to digitize these processes.\n\tIn April, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China recently made it clear that the scope of its new infrastructure includes technologies such as blockchain, 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies to upgrade the traditional infrastructure. Following the direction offered from the NDRC, JD.com is moving towards building a secure, efficient, and credible blockchain ecosystem to set the standard for the industry.\n\tThe e-commerce giant believes that blockchain technology has a huge potential to enhance supply chain transparency to ensure the quality and authenticity of their purchases. JD.com has already deployed its blockchain technology on over 50,000 products ranging from across over 700 brands.\n\tChinese institutions join China’s national blockchain committee\n\tThe Chinese central government has put together a national blockchain committee to work on setting industry standards. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a notice on April 13 of the “Public Notice on the Formation of a National Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Standardization Technical Committee.”\n\tOther committee members include executives from well-known Chinese institutions, including Baidu, Tencent, Huawei, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, amongst others.\n\tChina to build ‘digital central bank’ infrastructure\n\tChina’s Central Bank, People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is planning to look into building a digital central bank infrastructure to improve the standards of financial services in the country.\n\tOn May 18, the Chinese Central Bank’s 2020 video conference on scientific and technological work was held in Beijing. The meeting focused on the technological achievements made in 2019, an in-depth analysis of the current situation and challenges, and the upcoming key plans for 2020.\n\tA three-year FinTech development plan was set out for the country in August 2019, and 2020 has entered its second year. The development of blockchain, the internet of things (IoT), big data, and other innovative business models will also be expected to drive the digital transformation of the financial industry and promoting financial technology in the country.\n\tChina has also taken an ambitious step to “maintain its leading position in digital currency technology,” as it remains the central bank’s current top focus. According to Zhongtai Securities, the People’s Bank of China expects to be in the world’s leading position in digital currency development, as it continues to strive for efficient research and development, as well as technical testing of digital assets.\n",

The price of $15,960 is a new high for the year.\n\tAccording to data from Trading View, the BTC/USD pair has gained over $1800 dollars and 12.86% in the last 24 hours. According to crypto data analytics platform Messari, Bitcoin has now managed to stay above the $15,000 support for 20 days of its life-cycle, roughly 0.4% of its life.\n\tGrayscale CEO Barry Silbert, whose firm’s AUM is rising rapidly triumphantly reported on Twitter:\n\t“People will never again say Bitcoin is dead.”\n\tMicroStrategy is now looking like geniuses to the rest of the world after choosing Bitcoin as its reserve asset. As reported by MicroStrategy Bitcoin tracker on Twitter, the intelligence firm is up by $182 million dollar in the last 24 Hours—their original investment of $425 million in BTC is now valued at $607,639,500.\n\tBitcoin’s bullish behavior has been rampant in the lead up to the US elections and the prevailing uncertainty. While US presidential candidate Joe Biden is just six electoral votes away from victory, with officials continuing to count ballots in Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. Head of Research at Blockchain.com and top UK economist Dr. Garrick Hileman told Blockchain.News that the prevailing uncertainty is one of the forces behind BTC’s continued bull run. He said:\n\t\"Anything that negatively impacts the perception of a safe and stable dollar will likely boost interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”\n\tBTC is also surging amid the news the US Department of Justice has seized more than $1 billion dollars from an anonymous hack who managed to crack a wallet connected with the infamous silk road.\n\tFor now, the BTC price surge appears set to continue with may analyst predicting we should reach $17,000 in the next few days, but get ready for some extreme volatility as the markets continue to watch the election results.\n",

Meanwhile, Cross Link has $13 million and Decentraland has $4.63 million.\n\tDiluted market cap refers to the total value of the crypto at the price if the entire future supply of coins were in circulation.\n\tThe games with the highest market cap are the ones that dominate the crypto gaming scene. The overall worth of the game is denoted by the value of the full amount of available tokens.\n\tCrypto games have started to gain popularity as many have issued their own tokens that players can purchase or earn by playing the game.\n\tAxie Infinity also dominated the most searched games section of the report.\n\tWith over 29 million searches around the world, the game recorded the most number of searches in the past six months. The average search for other games hit 1.45 million.\n\tIn second and third places were Bomb Crypto and Splinterlands with 4.42 million and 2.59 searches respectively.\n\tAccording to Crypto Head, there is a great range in the value of tokens for crypto games, ranging from fractions of a penny to thousands of dollars; the average cost of the tokens ranked is $63.80.\n\tThe most expensive game tokens are from Yo Hero whose ‘YO’ token is valued at just over $2,021.\n\tCometh and Axie Infinity are very close in second and third positions with $59.23 and $58.54 per token respectively.\n\tSocial media, especially Twitter, is the driving force that is helping games gain popularity.\n\tAccording to the report, the average number of followers is just over 115,000, but the top three most popular games have more than that.\n\tAxie Infinity was dominant again with 915,600 Twitter followers, Decentraland and Star Atlas were second and third with 529,500 and 306,800 followers respectively.\n",

    "content": "\tGlobal payment provider PayPal Holdings Inc. revealed the company is planning to develop the next market in The United Kingdom to provide its crypto trading services.\n\tFollowing up the news coverage on Wednesday, more details to reveal PayPal’s upcoming development in the cryptocurrency business.\n\tIn response to questions from the analyst of Barclays Investment Bank about PayPal’s upcoming plan on the engaging crypto ecosystem in the quarters ahead, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said The U.K. is likely to be the next country to provide crypto trading.\n\t“We’re right in the middle of some open banking integration, which will increase the ability to fully integrate it into ACH and do faster payments. We’re going to launch, hopefully, maybe even next month in the U.K., open up trading there.”\n\tACH is PayPal’s Automated Clearing House, a payment service that enables merchants to electronically collect customer payments by directly debiting their checking or saving accounts.\n\tSchulman spoke at PayPal’s Q2 2021 earning call Wednesday. Per the coverage from FXStreet, Schulman said, “a new ‘digital wallet’ product will be introduced in Q3 this year and believe that cryptocurrency will be critical to PayPal’s growth. He described the upgrade of the super app wallet as “code complete”.\n\tHowever, Schulman did not confirm the timeline or roadmap of development to third party wallets. ” We’re working right now on transfers to third-party wallets, and we really want to make sure that we create a very seamless process for taxes and tax reporting.”\n\tAccording to the Cointelegraph report, the new crypto wallet will feature high yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, messaging capability, and crypto capabilities. “Each wallet would be unique, driven by advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities,” Schulman emphasised.\n\tMeanwhile, Schulman said the company is working on how to use smart contracts more efficiently and how to develop Defi applications as well.\n\tThe payment platform continues to expand its crypto-related business. Earlier this month, PayPal hired Jesse Spiro, a former Chainalysis head of policy and regulatory affairs, to lead the crypto division in PayPal.\n\tAround two weeks ago, PayPal also strengthened its crypto function and experience to its clients. The company has increased the limit of purchase of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets up to $10,000 weekly from $20,000, but also remove the annual purchase limit for qualified customers in the U.S, allowing to have more extensive accessibility on a crypto exchange.\n\tIn May, senior management also revealed that the company would enable their customers to withdraw their digital assets to third parties.\n",

Adam Back’s rant on Twitter called out a lot of big names in the game, as he tweeted:\n\t“Bitconnect, Charles Ponzi, Ethereum, Onecoin, Cardano, Ripple, Bernie Madoff, Stellar, Dan Larmer. All looking very similar grade to me.”\n\tBitconnect and Onecoin consist of two famous cryptos that were later revealed to be Ponzi schemes —investment scams that promise high rates of return but operate similarly to pyramid schemes by generating a return for earlier investors by recruiting new investors to the Ponzi. These scams originated from Bernie Madoff and Charles Ponzi.\n\tVitalik Buterin on Ethereum\n\tNeedless to say, Buterin and his counterpart Hoskinson, who recently announced big news pertaining to his crypto empire Cardano with the launch of Shelley hard fork. Vitalik Buterin took his frustrations to his Twitter account and retorted:\n\t“Ethereum is rising, proof of stake and sharding are rising, and rollups are here, all through a large distributed ecosystem working in parallel.”\n\tThe Ethereum founder stood by his blockchain company and countered Back’s statement by classifying it as old, ineffective propaganda.\n\tEthereum Announces Testnet Launch\n\tThe blockchain network had recently announced exciting news, coming forward with their long-anticipated final ETH 2.0 testnet launch, that was released on August 4, at 1 pm UTC. The testnet operates using a multi-client principal and is the test blockchain that will enable a transition from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake protocol for Ethereum.\n\tCardano — One Step Closer to Full Decentralization\n\tCardano founder Hoskinson also did not let Back’s comment slide, as he addressed Back and stated that it was pathetic that the Blockstream CEO lumped Cardano, Charles Ponzi and Bernie Madoff together.\n\tThe Cardano founder has been hard at work lately, with performance updates coming out for the Shelley network. Cardano is inching towards full decentralization, adding onto its existent features by adopting smart contracts, and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n\tCardano’s next development phase is the Goguen era, which is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2020 with its testnet release.\n",

Per the investment rate, the European Union notably has a shortfall of 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in both technologies.\n\t\"Companies and governments in Europe are substantially underinvesting in AI and blockchain compared to other leading regions, and it has become clear that the European Union struggles to translate its scientific excellence into the business application and economic success,\" the bank said in a report.\n\tThe EU believes the duo of both technologies can help overhaul the primary sectors, which the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily hit. These sectors include the health and financial sectors, as well as in business intelligence, respectively. Despite recognising the shortfall in the financing, the EIB said the current market condition could make this gap widen more.\n\t\"EU and member state support schemes could plug part of the gap, but private markets will need to contribute the balance,\" the bank said.\n\tThe EIB’s recommendation is coming when investors are generally enthused with American and Chinese markets. Some emerging tech firms and legacy institutions in Europe have favoured going public outside of the region, contributing to the build-up in the lack of investments in key emerging technologies. Besides these factors, the EIB highlights high upfront investment needs, lack of knowledge, and limited EU venture capital funds in both technologies.\n\tOn its part, the EIB is building a bond sale platform using blockchain technology.\n",

    "content": "\tFollowing its quarterly burn, the Binance (BNB) Chain has successfully eliminated $548 million worth of BNB, a move that has left the market relatively unaffected.\n\tCrypto exchange platform Binance in its latest news, announced it had successfully destroyed approximately 2,065,152.42 BNB.\n\tThe exchange platform also stated that an added 4,833.25 BNB was part of the burn through its Pioneer Burn Program – a burning program that favors those who genuinely lost their digital assets.\n\tBinance takes responsibility for these losses in the Pioneer Burn Program by deducting tokens (lost by users through honest mistakes) in the quarterly burn and then refunding the users depending on some specific conditions.\n\tBinance launched the BNB coin in 2017, and ever since, the exchange platform has been committed to burning a large amount of BNB coin every quarter. Initially, Binance started the BNB burn mechanism by buying back BNB coins with 20% of their profit and then destroying it until they bought back and burned 50% of BNB (100MM).\n\tHowever, in December 2021, the exchange platform introduced a new burning mechanism that relies on automatic on-chain calculations.\n\tThis means the BNB auto-burn system weighs the amount of BNB to be burnt automatically based on the price of BNB and the number of blocks produced during the quarter. In spite of the large amount of BNB coins burnt, the market seems rather unaffected by it, with the BNB coin moving downward and still hovering around $260 – at the time of writing.\n\tSpeaking of BNB, last week, the BNB blockchain suffered an on-chain hack that occurred on a bridge between blockchains. According to Binance, an estimated $100 million to $110 million of BNB tokens were stolen due to this hack.\n",

However, reports have said that the $1.8 trillion crypto sector has not completely accepted the requests from lawmakers.\n\tCrypto exchanges have turned a blind eye to orders for a cut off of all Russian users, which has given rise to concerns that Russia could use cryptocurrencies as a loophole to navigate around sanctions that have been put upon the country by the United States and Europe, according to a report by Blockchain.News.\n\tDavid Schwimmer, LSEG’s chief executive officer, said that crypto exchanges are stuck in between either abiding by the philosophy of independence from regulation or supporting the centralised system of global finance - which calls for the requirement of regulation and transparent frameworks.\n\tAnother report by Blockchain.News said that Russians with strong social connections, who are under international sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine, have been using cryptocurrencies to launder their wealth.\n\tCrypto watchdog firm Elliptic said that it found millions of crypto addresses connected to criminal activity and 400 digital asset providers who help users buy cryptocurrencies using rubles.\n\tAccording to Reuters, some crypto exchanges have rejected calls to cut off all Russian users, raising concerns that crypto could be used as a way to circumvent sanctions.\n\tOn the flip side, Ukraine has raised more than $100 million in cryptocurrencies after calling for help on social media for donations to aid their military and humanitarian needs in bitcoin and other digital tokens.\n\t“We at the FSB are monitoring the situation, the conflict situation relative to cryptos,” Patrick Armstrong, a member of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) secretariat, told a City & Financial conference in London.\n\tArmstrong said that the FSB - which groups financial regulators, central banks and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20 economies - is sharing the information it obtains among its members.\n\tThe European Union issued guidance on March 9 informing companies that sanctions on loans and credits include crypto assets to block potential sanctions loopholes.\n",

    "content": "\tAnalysis suggests institutional investors have an increasingly optimistic stance on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, while retail investors are still hesitant to return to the market.\n\tPreviously, BlackRock, the world's largest investment management firm, partnered with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading services to its institutional clients. A few days later, the company announced the launch of the Bitcoin Spot Private Trust.\n\tAccording to Bloomberg, Leah Wald, CEO of digital asset investment management firm Valkyrie Funds, said in an interview with Bloomberg that:\n\t“BlackRock really wouldn’t be doing this if there wasn’t significant demand from both institutional and retail clients.”\n\tThis institutional investment in the digital asset space shows that institutional interest in digital assets has not waned due to the slump in the cryptocurrency market.\n\tAccording to Coinbase’s second-quarter earnings report, the cryptocurrency exchange’s core retail customers have been inactive and on the sidelines.\n\tThe exchange recorded a record loss of $1.1 billion for the quarter.\n\tJames Malcolm, head of foreign exchange and crypto research at UBS, believes that the cryptocurrency market is still primarily a retail-driven market. That group will return when it feels like a bottom has been reached.\n\t“The hope is that at some point in the future, institutions will come into the space, institutional adoption will pick up a lot, and it will start to look more like traditional financial markets. But this is still predominantly a retail-driven market,” Malcolm added.\n\tNevertheless, retail investors continue jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon based on the rise of non-zero BTC addresses. Among small addresses, those holding less than one bitcoin are climbing rapidly, according to Market insight provider Glassnode.\n\tNoelle Acheson, Head of Market Insights at Genesis, said: “This suggests that retail is participating, just not yet in the kind of size that would add more momentum to the overall market.”\n",

The agreement is to provide this country with a population of 30 million with its unique CBDC solution Filia to accelerate the issuance of digital forms of the Ghanaian national currency Cedi and the realisation of the digitisation of government services.\n\tThe digital form of its currency, Cedi, is called Digital Cedi or \"e-Cedi\", which promotes payments without bank accounts, contracts, or smartphones as a digital alternative to cash to realize diversified payment forms.\n\tThe security, high availability, and flexibility of G+D's CBDC solution Filia can just support safe and continuous offline payments without a network connection.\n\tThe Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Ernest K. Y. Addision, has stated that:\n\t“From all indications, the concept has a significant role to play in the future of financial service delivery globally. This project is a significant step towards positioning Ghana to take full advantage of this emerging concept.\"\n\tThe solution will be divided into three phases to be tested in the trial phase in terms of banks, payment service providers, merchants, consumers, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\tThe three phases include the design phase that defines all the framework parameters of the CBDC pilot; the implementation phase that meets and adapts to the national conditions of Ghana, and the pilot phase of field testing under different backgrounds.\n\tGhana has confirmed that it is on the hunt for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) through the Bank of Ghana’s deputy governor, Dr. Maxwell Opoku-Afari, as reported by Blockchain.News on June 11, 2020.\n",

    "time": "2022-11-10",
    "author": "Samuel Edyme",
    "content": "\tThe European Parliament has passed a bill titled Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) addressing the cybersecurity of crypto and fintech companies.\n\tThe bill aims to create new rules relating to cybersecurity for the crypto asset, financial, and tech service providers. It is also passed to coordinate risk management requirements and procedures for reporting cybersecurity incidents.\n\tWith the DORA bill, Financial institutions will be needed to oversee and report security events, and tech service providers will be submitted to oversight by European regulators. Frances Fitzgerald, a centre-right member of the European Parliament who co-drafted the law, said in a statement:\n\t“Financial institutions and companies, including in the crypto space, hold extremely sensitive information about customers, and it is vital that EU-wide digital security measures are put in place to defeat the threat that exists.”\n\tThe new law will apply to EU-regulated financial entities, including traditional finance banking and investment firms and digital asset providers such as electronic money (e-money) and crypto-asset service providers. Other firms included tech service providers who provide IT solutions such as data analytics.\n\tThe legislation is passed by a margin of 556 in support and 18 against. Regulations corresponding with the law are said to be fully enforced in 24 months, which is in 2025, after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.\n\tFitzgerald further noted,\n\t“We need to implement stronger protections for our citizens. We do not want to see anyone's personal financial information hacked. The Digital Operational Resilience Act will ensure that Europe will remain an important center for investment.”\n\tNotably, the DORA bill comes after the EU parliament recently passed a bill, Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which received a 28:1 vote to scale, completing the tripartite deal required to push it into its next implementation phase.\n",

    "content": "\tThe average transaction fee for Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $1 due to falling market prices and lower mining difficulty.\n\tData shows that on August 22, the average Bitcoin transaction fee fell to $0.825. This is the first time to fall below $1 in more than two years.\n\tThe Bitcoin ecosystem has also suffered from quite high transaction fees in the past, jumping further over $60 in 2021, such a high fee.\n\tTypically, when the usage of the Bitcoin network is high, transaction fees go up. Transactions compete for limited space in Bitcoin blocks. This leads to competition for transaction fees as users race to get their transactions included in the next block.\n\tHowever, the difficulty of mining new BTC blocks is steadily decreasing as miners recover from a chronic shortage of chips and gain access to cheaper hardware.\n\tThis has also become a major contributor to the reduction of transaction fees.\n\tAt the same time, the slump in cryptocurrency has also led to a decrease in the number of mining people.\n\tThe member pool is much looser than before, and all valid transactions have to wait for the confirmation of the Bitcoin network. If the pool of members keeps getting crowded, then fees will keep going up as people primarily want confirmation over others and vice versa.\n\tMany investors and consumers have opted out of the cryptocurrency market as traders, investors and consumers take a wait-and-see approach to the long-term outlook after Bitcoin's devaluation.\n\tBitcoin has fallen more than 60% from its high of $69,000 last year. At the time of writing, the benchmark cryptocurrency was trading at $21,106, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n",

The newly appointed prime minister has brought a lot of excitement to many crypto enthusiasts as they hope this would mean the UK crypto market could advance more under Sunak’s regime.\n\tRishi Sunak is a former Goldman Sachs analyst who has also served as a chancellor between February 2020 and July 2022. In April this year, Sunak released a proposal aiming to make the U.K a crypto-friendly tech hub. In the proposal, Sunak encouraged the UK’s Royal Mint, the official maker of UK coins, to launch an official NFT collection of the nation – an idea some have criticized as a \"poorly judged gimmick.”\n\tHe also helped the U.K make plans on how the U.K government should regulate stablecoins so as to make them recognized as a legal means of payment in the country.\n\t“We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create – here in the UK, and by regulating effectively, we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term,” said Rishi Sunak.\n\tPrior to Sunak’s leadership victory, Liz Truss, who is now the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced her resignation, 44 days after assuming office on September 6.\n\tAs reported by Blockchain.News, Truss’s resignation was fueled by the errors in her proclaimed mini-budget and tax cuts that were announced by the former Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\tThe policy, at the time, riled the markets, with the stock market recording unprecedented slumps, a trend that also affected the British Pound.\n",

The grand jury for the case was sworn in on May 7, 2019.\n\tTian and Li who also go by their GOT inspired online aliases, Snowsjohn and Khaleesi respectively, have been charged with stealing nearly $250 million worth of virtual assets between July 2018 and April 2019.\n\tAccording to the court documents, Tian and Li both held accounts at two different unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges. The pair violated legal requirements set out by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) by converting virtual currency into fiat currency in exchange for fees; the pair effectively operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\tTian and Li transferred over $100 million worth of Bitcoin between each other’s US accounts and China accounts engaging in a form of cryptocurrency laundering know as a “peel chain” before the hack occurred. Other forms of laundering mainly consisted of converting Bitcoin to USD, Chinese Yuan, and iTunes gift cards.\n\tTian and Li Linked to Lazarus Group\n\tAs announced by the US Treasury on March 2, Tian and Li have been identified for their connection to the North Korean state-sponsored cyber-crime syndicate known as the Lazarus group.\n\tThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has reportedly been training cybercriminals to target and launder stolen funds from financial institutions, with a series of attacks leading to a subsequent UN investigation last year.\n\tOn Sep. 13, 2019, the US Treasury identified the Lazarus Group, along with Bluenoroff and Andariel, as North Korean hacking entities based on their relationship to the DPRK’s primary intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RCB).\n\tThe court documents do not name either of the exchanges hacked, however, last November the South Korean exchange Upbit was the subject of an attack with a total of 342,000 ETH, a value of $50 million at the time, stolen from the Upbit Ethereum Hot Wallet.\n",

They could include solutions such as custody, staking and trading services.\n\tRecently, the startup successfully raised $350 million in a Series D funding round led by investment firm KKR. Other participants included traditional players such as Goldman Sachs and Thoma Bravo, along with crypto-native firms such as Alameda Research and Blockchain Capital.\n\t\"We work with institutions and what we see is that institutions have very long-term horizons; they are not stopping these partnerships,\" Mónica said.\n\tIn another major development, Anchorage will become the preferred custodian for buzzy new layer one blockchain Aptos.\n\tIn a recent interview with CoinDesk, Mónica said, \"by partnering with Aptos, we are actually helping make sure that the next generation of layer 1 blockchains are taking these proper [security] considerations, and that will only spur future growth in the industry.\"\n",

    "content": "\tWhenever discussions about the benefits of cryptocurrency adoption take place, there are often misconceptions about which ethnic groups, in general, know the most and which stand to gain the most from the decentralized technology. While the value and power of cryptocurrency have been steadily recognized in parts of Africa due to necessity with inflation and remittance, this type of adoption is not taking place within the African American community.\n\tThe African-American community is in the majority recognized to be at an economic disadvantage, with an existing legacy financial system propelled by unethical practices such as redlining, among others. However, cryptocurrency, by its nature, could serve to rectify such circumstances and level the playing field for all involved.\n\tOn Feb. 23, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, tweeted his support of a new book that promotes Bitcoin’s substantial potential benefits to the African-American community. Dorsey, whose Twitter platform now hosts about 330 million users globally, told his own 4.3 million followers how Bitcoin could prove to be a potential lifesaver to the African-American community.\n\tThe book, Bitcoin and Black America, written by Isaiah Jackson, offers a breakdown of the role cryptocurrency can take in the African-American perspectives, a group with a history of being underserved by major financial bodies. As noted by the writer, it is quite surprising that black people in the US are yet to embrace cryptocurrency despite the fact that it offers a potential route to financial autonomy.\n\tCall for change in perception of cryptocurrency to the African-American community?\n\tAccording to Jackson, one of the major problems among the African-American community is their outlook on cryptocurrency. Although they are not the only group that sees Bitcoin as a potential scam, with news of several schemes being employed to exploit the lack of regulations in place for cryptocurrency, Misinformation coupled with lack of banking access has made investing in cryptocurrency less appealing among the black people in the United States.\n\tIn his book, Jackson called for a quick change in order not to miss the potential benefits that could be derived from the use of Bitcoin. His sentiment seems to have been shared by the Twitter CEO, as shown in his tweet yesterday. Recently, Jack has also been seen to show interest in this space as he has made efforts to come up with a decentralized social media platform earlier this year.\n",

It will provide decentralized identity, trusted storage, private ownership, and decentralized messaging for Nimble community members on the Algorand blockchain. Both parties are enthusiastic about this collaboration as it will help DeFi investors have something to fall back on in case of hacks or private key misplacement.\n\tNimble is a global decentralized insurance company deploying Web3.0 and blockchain tools and technology to power the community-centric future of efficient and equitable insurance processes.\n\tMeanwhile, Verida is a network of personal data owned and collected by users, incentivizing them to unlock their data stored on centralized platforms.\n\tA threat or hack could lead to the loss of millions of cryptocurrencies locked in a smart contract. Similarly, a misplacement or hack of a crypto wallet could lead to a loss of all assets in the wallet. These are unforeseen circumstances that could be experienced in the crypto world as investors aim to make a fortune in the crypto market.\n\tThe decentralized finance ecosystem currently valued at $96 billion is a crypto niche with lots of uncertainties and rewards. In 2021, the DeFi industry recorded around $10 billion, which was lost due to the hacks of various smart contracts. This alone is one factor that hinders the widespread adoption of decentralized finance, as most investors are scared of losing their hard-earned assets to hackers.\n\tTo curtail this, DeFi insurance was implemented to buy coverage against losses caused by uncertainties in the DeFi industry.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revealed its plan to kick start a proof-of-concept phase on the issuance of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) next year. The nation’s central bank reported that it was preparing its issuance capabilities in case of a surge in public demand for digital currency rose rapidly.\n\tResilience is of the Key\n\tThe BOJ report noted that one of the fundamental features of the CBDC would be resilience, even when faced with unforeseeable circumstances like power outages and network failures. It stated:\n\t“Offline use in times of system and network failures, as well as electrical outages, is also important for Japan, given the frequent occurrence of natural disasters.”\n\tAs a result, the digital currency will have offline capabilities making it more durable. The early experimentation phase will entail generating a test environment to check its functionality as a payment apparatus.\n\tIn July, the BOJ disclosed that it had identified two technical stumbling blocks in the issuance of its digital currency, namely resilience and universal access. Therefore, it seems it has set its eyes on overcoming the resilience challenge, having put the early testing phase in line.\n\tUniversal access entails granting entry to everyone, including those who do not use smartphones. The Proof of Concept testing is expected to tackle this technical hitch as it will ensure that the digital Yen is accessible, just like regular currency. Additionally, it will guarantee the availability of the asset should there be a natural disaster.\n\tStamping authority in the global markets\n\tIn the eyes of many nations owning a CBDC is instrumental in having control of the global markets. This can be shown by the fact that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), along with seven central banks, recently released a report identifying the foundational principles necessary for any publicly available CBDCs to help central banks meet their public policy objectives.\n\tOne of the principles highlighted the importance of CBDCs coexisting with cash and other types of money in an innovative and flexible payment system.\n\tThe BOJ has been making notable steps as it continues keeping a keen eye on the development of its digital currency. For instance, in July, it announced the appointment of lead economist Kazushige Kamiyama to head the payments and settlements department, which is at the helm of Japan’s exploration of its CBDC project.\n",

    "time": "2022-10-05",
    "author": "Blockchain.News Marketing",
    "content": "\tGeneva, Switzerland, 6th October, 2022, Chainwire\n\tH.E. Justin Sun, founder of TRON and the Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization, attended TOKEN2049 in Singapore. It took place on 28-29 September. Sun was invited to share his insights on the decade ahead in the panel session titled \"The Future of Crypto: Navigating the Decade Ahead.”\n\tThe first question for the panel was directed to Sun – “What is the future of crypto?” Sun reflected that 2022 is his 10 year anniversary since getting into crypto. He believes, “The first 10 years of crypto were all about gaining mainstream attention, while this next decade will be all about gaining mainstream adoption. In doing so, crypto will need to learn lots from the history of traditional financial institutions, as we take on the huge responsibility of providing financial services for everyone. We need to help people feel confident we can do that.”\n\tOrganized annually in both London and Singapore, TOKEN2049 drew many leading crypto leaders and brands as well as 3,000 participants from across the world. Together, they sought to arrive at innovative action steps to counter some of the prevailing problems facing the crypto industry today. A key focus at this year’s conference was also to discover solutions to the looming financial crisis through blockchain and other emerging technologies.\n\tJoining the panel discussion, Sun had an in-depth conversation with COO of FTX Constance Wang, Jump Crypto Partner and Head of Investments Saurabh Sharma, and LongHash Ventures CEO and Founding Partner Emma Cui. Sun was the only panelist who had founded a Layer 1 blockchain. He reaffirmed his and TRON’s commitment to a decentralized financial future together, one that empowers everyone.\n\t“Even though we [the panelists] have different ways of approaching the blockchain, what we must do is strive collaboratively. This is the key for blockchain development. TRON’s focus is primarily on stablecoins, but it also offers DeFi, NFT, exchange, CeFi, and other services. Our competitors aren't each other, they are traditional financial institutions, insurance companies, and investment platforms. The future is moving forward by offering a full deck of financial services together.”\n\tSun went on later to say, “Stablecoins are TRON’s priority and focus and have been since day one. Why? Because they provide a vast store of value for the greatest number of people. People in the US have easy access to a bank. It’s like normal everyday infrastructure for them. But for most of the rest of the world, 95% of the population even, they can only hold their own native currency, but not US dollars. The blockchain provides users a way to have their own sort of bank account, creating a wallet in 5 seconds with zero costs. Then they can store a US dollar equivalent stablecoin in their own wallet, which provides them access into the broader global economy.”\n\tAt a previous top-level WTO conference, Sun also emphasized the significance of developing blockchain technology for global economic growth. Speaking as head of the Grenada delegate at the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva on 12-17 June, 2022, he addressed that the development of e-commerce and the broader digital economy, including blockchain and other technologies, would greatly boost the global economy.\n\tAs an acknowledged pioneer in the sector of blockchain technology, Sun has been dedicated to upgrading the global financial infrastructure and continues to endeavor toward fully decentralized autonomous protocols and organizations.\n\tAbout TRON DAO\n\tTRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.\n\tFounded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2022, it has over 114 million total user accounts on the blockchain, nearly 3.9 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON’s official entry into decentralized stablecoins.\n\tTRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum\n",

In such attacks, ransomware groups often demand their pay in bitcoin.\n\tAccording to Reuters, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, a database shared across a network of computers, in which records are difficult to change once added.\n\tBlockchain.News on February 17, 2022, reported that the FBI said law enforcement can barely keep up with the advancements of criminal activities in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\tThe FBI said that cybercriminals have embraced digital innovations in the cryptocurrencies technology so rapidly that it is getting hard to keep up, the report added.\n\tBitcoin has become the most favourable form of cryptocurrency payment among criminals in ransomware attacks since it is unhackable and can be transferred in large amounts instantly without having to go through a banking system.\n",

However, Kwon is yet to reply to an email sent by Bloomberg seeking comment.\n\tKwon's tokens, including Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC), collapsed massively after the arrest warrant was issued. LUNA was trading as low as $2.4964 at 3:55 PM HKT, down over 35.7%. Its market cap was down to over $347 million from over $555.12 million, while LUNC was trading at $0.0002716, down by over 22.3% during the Asia trading section, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\tTerra Classic is home to the algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (UST). It's now-renamed LUNC token collateralized UST, which crashed in a bank run in May.\n\tThe fall of the Terra Platform in May led to the historic collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins, which has affected the faith of many people in the digital-asset sector. Currently, the crypto sector still remains rattled by the downfall of the stablecoin, and recovery is still under process.\n\tDo Kwon also helped create Luna as part of the Terraform Labs crypto ecosystem, which also lost its value during the fall of the ecosystem.\n\tThe ecosystem collapsed when TerraUSD - also known as UST - crumbled from its dollar peg and brought down the ecosystem he had built, after which, the prices of both tokens tumbled to near zero, a shadow of the combined $60 billion they once controlled.\n\tFurthermore, the collapse of Terraform Labs’ associated tokens - LUNA and the UST stablecoin - effectively ushered in the first wave of the crypto winter.\n\tTerra’s unravelling has triggered probes in South Korea and the US, as well as renewed regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins - digital tokens that are pegged to an asset like the dollar.\n\tCurrently, the probe into Terraform Labs by South Korean prosecutors is taking a whole new twist as watchdogs are making consultations on how best to classify the collapsed LUNA tokens - now known as Luna Classic (LUNC) - according to a report from Blockchain.News.\n\tAs reported by the Korean Herald, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office’s Financial and Securities Crime Joint Investigation Team is consulting with industry stakeholders to determine the best designation for LUNA coins, according to the report.\n\tFollowing the plummet in prices, companies who had exposure to the assets suffered such financial challenges that many, like Three Arrows Capital (3AC), could not recover from, the report stated.\n\tHowever, Do Kwon has committed to cooperating with the investigations when the time comes. Bloomberg reported that in an interview with crypto media startup Coinage that floated the prospect of jail time, Kwon said, “Life is long.”\n\tAccording to a report from a local media platform, the Yonhap news agency, Do Kown was subject to a \"Search and Seizure\" in July.\n\tThe raid was reportedly conducted on the operating office of 15 trading platforms and organisations that have connections to Terraform Labs. While the raid was not projected to last that long, the report had it that prosecutors were very focused on getting as much data as possible to bolster their investigative work on Terraform Labs.\n\t\"The amount of data requested by the prosecution was so enormous that it was impossible to complete the search and seizure within one day,\" one of the exchange’s officials said, \"If the data is insufficient while conducting forensics, it seems that it took time because the prosecution requested to extract more data through a data analyst.\"\n\tWhile the Korean Herald reported that South Korean prosecutors are broadening their investigations into the company. This move has stirred targeted raids on the home premises of Terraform Labs Co-Founder Daniel Shin as well as those of trading platforms that are suspected to have dealings with the now defunct company.\n",

    "content": "\tOn January 29, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made a groundbreaking move in the realm of digital currencies by conducting its first cross-border digital dirham transfer. This transfer, amounting to 50 million dirhams (equivalent to $13.6 million), was sent to China utilizing the mBridge central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform.\n\tThe transfer was overseen by Sheikh Mansour, the chairman of the board of the Central Bank of the UAE, during the golden jubilee celebration of the bank's establishment. This event is not just a significant milestone for the UAE but also a remarkable step in the global advancement of digital currencies.\n\tThe mBridge platform, introduced in 2021, is a collaborative effort between the central monetary authorities of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlement (BIS). It stands out as the only international collaborative partnership that includes China. The first pilot of Project mBridge was completed in September 2022, and since then, it has onboarded multiple commercial banks from each participating nation to develop its infrastructure and technology.\n\tmBridge utilizes a single-platform, direct-access architecture, employing the HotStuff+ consensus mechanism to facilitate real-time, peer-to-peer transactions. This innovative approach allows for faster transfers of each participant country’s national digital currency, showcasing the potential of CBDCs in streamlining cross-border payments.\n\tThe use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology for digital currencies has gained significant interest worldwide. According to a BIS report, nearly 90% of central banks globally are exploring the adoption of CBDCs. Among these, 11 countries have already launched a CBDC, 15 are in the pilot stage, and 26 are in the development phase. This trend indicates a growing acknowledgment of the potential benefits and efficiencies that CBDCs can bring to the global financial system.\n\tThe success of the UAE's digital dirham transfer via mBridge highlights the increasing integration of blockchain technology in national and international finance, potentially reshaping the future of money transfer and economic transactions globally.\n",

    "content": "\tSouth Korean financial authorities expressed their opposite stance against Busan City to provide special regulatory support for foreign crypto firms to establish digital asset exchanges, local media outlet Money Today reported Thursday.\n\tThe Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Financial Services Commission of South Korea said judicial risks, investor risks and money laundering risks exist in cooperation with foreign cryptocurrency exchanges that will cause reverse discrimination against local cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\t“If Busan City unreasonably rushes to establish a digital asset exchange, it may be criticized for saying that the referee (government) acts as the player (operator) before the disciplinary system advises.\n\tOn Aug. 26, the South Korean city of Busan signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, which will help the local government to establish its own exchange or the Busan digital asset exchange.\n\tBusan city government also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with FTX on August 30 and Huobi Global on September 14, agreeing to cooperate in establishing digital asset exchange. The city of Busan has pledged to provide administrative support for these overseas exchanges to enter South Korea.\n\tHowever, South Korean financial authorities warned that Chinese coin exchanges such as Binance or Huobi Global are currently under investigation by foreign regulators, such as U.S. regulators the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating whether Binance violated securities laws.\n\tThe financial regulators pointed out that South Korea will be criticized for cooperation projects with such \"flawed companies\".\n\tAll three exchanges named are headquartered in the famous tax havens of Malta and the Bahamas; if these exchanges first operate in South Korea or establish a joint exchange with Busan City, there will be a high risk of money laundering.\n\tThe administration is concerned there may have a possibility that Chinese coin exchanges would invade the business field of South Korean exchanges if securities token trading through South Korean exchanges is allowed.\n\tSouth Korean crypto exchange Coredax also objected to the local city government decision, saying it would hinder the development of crypto assets in the country and deepen foreign dependence.\n",

    "content": "\tFortune Business Insights has revealed that the blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) sector will escalate to $24.94 billion by 2027 from $1.9 billion recorded in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.5%. According to the press release shared with Blockchain.News, this uptrend will be fueled by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as they are viewing blockchain technology as an optimal solution for the numerous challenges they face, like access to bank loans, trade financing, and cash flow difficulties.\n\tBaaS cuts out middlemen\n\tSMEs are continuously looking forward to stamping their authority across the globe, but this necessitates considerable financial resources. BaaS is playing an instrumental role in simplifying access to different trade financing sources. Additionally, its decentralized nature is eradicating middlemen, making it favored by SMEs.\n\tThe World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that blockchain technology can be pivotal in bridging the trade financing gap globally. Recently, the WEF asserted that blockchain should be viewed as the vaccine for future disruptions like the one triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in the seafood industry, hence showing its confidence in this technological innovation.\n\tSMEs are reaping the benefits in BaaS in supply chain processes as transparency, immutability, and traceability become inevitable.\n\tThe report also noted that the North American BaaS market stood at $1.01 billion in 2019 based on the significant number of blockchain development projects taking place in the United States. A market rise is expected in this region because BaaS solutions are continuously being integrated with public utilities services.\n\tOn the other hand, the BaaS sector in Asia-Pacific will be boosted by incredible blockchain investment by China, Japan, and South Korea governments.\n\tAdoption of BaaS solutions by Huawei and Microsoft\n\tMicrosoft and Huawei have been setting the ball rolling in implementing BaaS alternatives. For instance, Huawei executed a blockchain service powered by Linux Foundation’s Hyperledge Fabric 1.0 to assist companies in incorporating smart contracts in supply chains in April 2018.\n\tConversely, Microsoft’s Azure blockchain service was adopted in May 2019 to assist customers design cloud-based blockchain networks.\n\tBaaS is being viewed as the icing on the cake in many industries across the globe. For instance, leading fast-food chain, KFC recently opted for blockchain-enabled media buying and digital advertisements for its Middle Eastern customers.\n",

    "content": "\tBlock.one today announced a new suite of enterprise service offerings designed to help organizations integrate blockchain-based solutions into their operations. The announcement comes following a recent PwC report that predicts blockchain has the potential to boost global gross domestic product (GDP) by $1.76 trillion.\n\tAccording to an email shared with Blockchain.News, the four new offerings will leverage Block.one’s performance-focused EOSIO software and will include Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), consulting, technical support, and training and certification programs.\n\tPwC Predicts Huge Growth For Blockchain\n\tWhile blockchain is most known as the underlying infrastructure supporting cryptocurrencies, PwC experts reviewed other key advantages of the distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\tFive case scenarios in which blockchain could be used to drive the digital revolution forward included provenance – the tracking and tracing of products and services – payments and financial services, identity management, and the application of blockchain in contracts and dispute resolution as well as customer engagement.\n\tSpeaking about the potential ways blockchain technology could be used, Steve Davies, a Partner and Blockchain Leader at PwC UK, said:\n\t“Blockchain technology has long been associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but there is so much more that it has to offer, particularly in how public and private organisations secure, share and use data.”\n\tThe analysis evaluated blockchain technology’s potential across different industries, from healthcare, government and public services to finance, logistics, retail, and more.\n\tAccording to PwC analysts, Asia stands to reap the most economic benefits from blockchain technology over other continents.\n\tIn terms of countries, China and the US were designated as the ones that could potentially gain the highest net benefits from blockchain, estimated at $440 billion and $407 billion respectively, according to data from PwC. The net benefits of five countries, notably Germany, Japan, the UK, France, and India were also calculated to surpass $50 billion.\n\tOverall, across all sectors, the public administration, healthcare, and education industry appears to be the biggest beneficiaries, with PwC expecting them to gain approximately $574 billion by 2030 through using blockchain for identity and credentials.\n\tBlockchain Enterprise Entrance\n\tAs enterprise digital transformation continues to drive corporate growth, organizations are exploring blockchain-based solutions for more reliable, secure and transparent data infrastructure.\n\tThe accelerated interest and adoption of the technology has left a growing gap in both technical expertise and resources needed to effectively incorporate blockchain solutions. Block.one’s EOSIO for Business is focused on closing this gap with simple yet powerful solutions.\n\tBlock.one Chief Operating Officer Ted Cahall:\n\t“Despite knowing the inherent benefits that blockchain will deliver to their business operations, many in-house product engineering teams are wary of the complexity involved in setting up and administering their own blockchain […] Our EOSIO for Business customers will be able to work directly with EOSIO experts to ensure that their implementations seamlessly integrate with existing technology, and they will also have exclusive access to the newest EOSIO features and upgrades - all of which will enable in-house teams to focus on other business priorities while still benefiting from the reliability and security of their new blockchain systems.”\n\tThe four major components of EOSIO for Business include:\n\tClients are already benefiting from Block.one’s enterprise support. Mythical Games, the game technology studio on the Forbes “Disruptive Technology Companies to watch” list, uses EOSIO for Business services to create digital ecosystems around player-owned economies.\n\tRudy Koch, Co-founder and SVP of Business Development at Mythical Games said:\n\t“At Mythical, we are redefining game economies and creating new revenue opportunities by putting more power and ownership in the hands of players and content creators [...] EOSIO is an integral part of our efforts. Leveraging Block.one’s EOSIO BaaS service enables us to continue delivering world-class game technology products to our players and partners.”\n",

    "time": "2021-05-04",
    "author": "Annie Li",
    "content": "\tAlthough Ripple is still battling with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reach a conclusion on the outcome of XRP in the United States, the recent price action of XRP has been bullish. The surge in XRP's price can be allocated to several events that has served to positively influence XRP's price.\n\tPhemex crypto exchange announced that it will relist XRP on its trading platform, as the cryptocurrency is in “great demand” on April 28. On the following day, Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO of SBI Group, revealed that an initial public offering may be in Ripple's future plans.\n\tHowever, due to the overall downturn in the cryptocurrency market, it may be difficult for XRP to maintain the above-mentioned upward momentum.\n\tAccording to Coinmarketcap, Ripple is ranked as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $67 billion.\n\tRipple (XRP) Price Analysis\n\tJudging from the daily candlestick chart, yesterday, a bearish Doji pattern was formed on the chart, which implies that Ripple may soon reverse. Today, as Bitcoin has dropped 3.89% from its stable $58K level to the $55,795 level within 24 hours, the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen to varying degrees. Ripple (XRP) is no exception.\n\tXRP dropped by 7.55% in 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ripple is trading at $1.46.\n\tFrom the perspective of transaction volume, compared with the previous transaction volume, there are obvious signs of shrinking. It seems unlikely that there will be large fluctuations in the next trading day. This implies that bullish investors are still hesitant to buy in large quantities, but choose better timing and lower prices to buy on dips.\n\tCurrently, the price of Ripple is still running above the Exponential Moving Average ribbon. However, the Relative Strength Index indicator, which is developing downward and gradually approaching the equilibrium point of the bulls and bears sides, will continue to weaken on time.\n\tThe bear side will push the price down to the 20 day-Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which may put the defensive line to the test in the next trading.\n\tThe blue K line of the MACD indicator is glued down with the yellow Signal line. This indicates that the bullish momentum is weakening.\n\tIf the bulls can actively defend the 20-EMA of $1.38 support, then Ripple (XRP) is still in an uptrend. A break below the 20-EMA of $1.38 may indicate the beginning of a deeper correction to the 50-EMA of $1.12.\n",

Resulting in a $77 million deal, Huobi became Pantronic’s largest shareholder with more than a 73 percent stake. It has been assumed that the ultimate goal of the deal was to allow Huobi to conduct a reverse IPO in Hong Kong.\n\tStricter regulations on reverse IPOs from the HKEX planned ahead for October 1 may affect the company’s move. HKEX stated that it would change current regulations, meaning it would be harder for those that acquire a publicly listed company in different industries based in Hong Kong.\n",

Alone, the worldwide blockchain market size projects to grow to $23.3 billion by 2023 hinged on an 80.2% compound annual growth rate. Market size totaled $1.2 billion in 2018.\n\tTangible and intangible asset management has also become more efficient due to tokenization and fractionalization across the crypto world. These endeavors present liquidity opportunities for assets not found in the traditional fiat world.\n\tProjects like Gleec focus on fostering the real-world use of cryptocurrencies through a range of products that streamline and simplify the ability to buy, sell, trade, and store digital assets. Following in the footsteps of the native Gleec Coin, the recently-introduced Gleec BTC digital asset exchange to speed up mass crypto adoption.\n\tGleec BTC’s Exchange: Building On Scalable Solution’s Software\n\tThe newly-minted Gleec BTC exchange allows users to trade the native Gleec Coin along with GLEEC/BTC, GLEEC/EUR, and BTC/EUR trading pairs. The exchange features an accompanying Google Play and Apple iOS app for users to access, according to the project’s team.\n\tLicensed in Estonia by the nation’s Agency of Economic Activities, the Gleec team utilized white label software from Scalable Solutions to craft the exchange.\n\tScalable Solutions, founded by Mark Berger, works with companies to harness technologies like Microsoft Azure with .NET and Open Source while focusing on product engineering services. Scalable Solutions is known across the crypto world for its industry-leading trading engine that has facilitated exchange growth.\n\tGleec CEO and co-founder Daniel Dimitrov remarks how “after listing Gleec Coin on exchanges that run on Scalable Solutions' infrastructure and starting to actively trade on them, we realized the potential of the underlying exchange technology. We then decided to replace our existing exchange infrastructure for Scalable’s in order to provide our wide user base with the best trading experience in the market.”\n\tThe Gleec BTC exchange will profit from deep liquidity and a modular technological approach that aids in scalability. According to the Gleec Team, the user experience remains a priority through traceability, guaranteed security, and steps to promote transparency as coins are bought, sold, traded, and stored on the exchange.\n\tPart Of A Stepping Stone Towards The Future\n\tIn the midst of launching the new Gleec BTC exchange, the native Gleec Coin is also listing on the Bittrex and Bithumb exchange.\n\tPlans also include a prepaid Visa Gleec Card that gives holders the ability to spend Gleec Coin in more than 40 million worldwide terminals.\n\tThree years after the launch of Gleec Coin, the team hopes the newly-launched digital asset exchange benefits the cryptocurrency community as a whole.\n",

    "content": "\tMore than 7,500 ether ($8 million) was hacked from Uniswap on Monday, according to a report from The Block.\n\tThe report stated that the hacker stole from a wallet reportedly to be a liquidity provider on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\tPeckShield, a smart contract security firm, reported to The Block that the hacker was able to steal the cryptocurrency from Uniswap through a phishing tactic.\n\tIt elaborated that the hacker targeted the liquidity provider using a fake Uniswap airdrop token as a phishing bait prior to the hacking incident. Following this, the victim claimed the token and interacted with the malicious smart contract that indirectly gave the hacker total control over their wallet.\n\tAccording to The Block, the wallet was providing $8 million to a WBTC/USDC liquidity pool on Uniswap version 3 during the attack.\n\tAfter the attack, the hacker exited the user’s liquidity position, swapped the assets and transferred them out. The Block added that the hacker routed the funds through Tornado Cash - a transaction mixer on the Ethereum network.\n\tThe hacking incident has come three weeks after Uniswap hired the former president of the New York Stock Exchange as its adviser.\n\tStacey Cunningham will help bolster Uniswap Labs’ business with a focus on regulation for Uniswap’s role in DeFi, Blockchain.News reported.\n\tIn a statement, Cunningham said that she joined Uniswap Labs because “she believes in the potential of a decentralized exchange and in Uniswap’s commitment to fairer markets.”\n\tThe hack in Uniswap's wallet and the new appointment has come despite the challenging market environment currently.\n\tThe prolonged plunge in crypto prices and wider tech sector woes have led many crypto firms to lay off workers as market participants brace for further difficult roads ahead.\n\tA number of crypto firms such as Coinbase, BlockFi, Crypto.com, and Middle Eastern crypto exchange Rain Financial, among others recently cut dozens of jobs due to the difficult market, Blockchain.News reported.\n",

    "content": "\tHidden Road Partners is in talks with hedge funds and many of the top 20 global banks about providing access to trade or hedging their crypto risks, Bloomberg reported citing executives at the firm.\n\tHidden Road Partners is a prime brokerage focusing on digital assets and foreign exchange.\n\tLast month, Hidden Road Partners completed a $50 million funding round last month that included Citadel Securities, as well as the investment arms of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX Trading Ltd. and Coinbase Global Inc.\n\tThis move by the prime brokerage startup is being seen to ease Wall Street's entry into crypto trading by tackling counterparty risks and conflicts of interest.\n\tManaging counterparty risk has come at a critical time as the recent crypto downturn has led to the default of influential crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and crypto lenders and brokers such as Celsius Network Ltd. and Voyager Digital Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\t\"Such credit risks could hamper traditional funds' interests in trading directly with cryptocurrency firms,\" Bloomberg said.\n\tRamnik Arora, a general partner at FTX's venture arms, said, \"the recent episode with crypto lenders has made it abundantly clear that the industry is in need of better real-time credit risk management.\"\n\t\"Hidden Road is making it easier for risk-conscious borrowers to access credit markets, reducing systemic risk for the ecosystem.\"\n\tThe startup was founded in 2018 by Marc Asch, formerly with Steven Cohen's hedge fund SAC Capital and Point72 Asset Management. Hidden Road initially started with foreign-exchange services and expanded into digital assets in October.\n\tThe company allows banks or other institutions to post dollars as collateral in a \"tri-party\" set up with a custodian and receive profits and losses in dollars. However, this is only limited to those banks or institutions that cannot hold digital assets directly.\n\tClients can trade with exchanges as well as liquidity providers, including Virtu Financial Inc., Optiver BV and Wintermute Trading Ltd.\n\tThere is an increasing number of crypto platforms and brokers vying for institutional traders. But Hidden Road claims that, unlike many others, its pure-play structure would eliminate potential conflict of interests.\n\t\"The firm takes on counterparty risks on behalf of the client and the crypto exchange or market maker. If a counterparty defaults, the startup would be on the hook for completing the defaulted side of the trade. In exchange, Hidden Road's prime-brokerage fee incorporates this aspect of credit risk,\" Bloomberg said.\n\tThe business model for Hidden Road does not include carrying a huge balance sheet to lend to its clients; instead, the firm raises capital from investors such as pension funds and pays them a return on capital. It generates returns by providing financing to clients for their trading activities.\n\tThe company's risk mitigation involves using a real-time system, which sets risk limits and requires portions of collateral upfront.\n\tHidden Road said it plans to enter futures and options clearing.\n",

    "time": "2024-01-13",
    "author": "Luisa Crawford",
    "content": "\tHelium Farm, a prominent player in crypto-mining, recently announced the introduction of three distinct mining plans. These plans are tailored to provide investors with attractive returns based on the current market price of Helium (HNT).\n\tPlan Details\n\tMobile Plan ($435/year): This plan is designed to yield high returns, projecting daily returns of 0.40 to 1.10 HNT, which translates to approximately $2.5 to $6.80 per day based on current HNT values.\n\tCluster Plan ($3,765/year): The premium option in the trio, the Cluster Plan, offers the most lucrative returns, with an anticipated daily return of 4.10 to 10.90 HNT. This equates to roughly $25.4 to $67.60 daily.\n\tThese plans include zero maintenance costs and cover installation and hosting services, ensuring a 24-hour seamless mining experience. Helium Farm facilitates passive income through daily HNT payouts, combined with exceptional service and robust data security.\n\tFinancial Projections\n\tThe financial attractiveness of these plans remains strong even in adverse market conditions. For example, if the HNT price falls to $5, the Mobile Plan would still yield $2 to $5.50 per day, while the Cluster Plan could offer $20.50 to $54.50 daily. In a more optimistic scenario, with HNT reaching $10, the returns could be significantly higher.\n\tExclusive Services\n\tHelium Farm is not just about offering mining plans. They provide robust data security, ensuring a secure environment for users’ information. The platform believes in effortless withdrawals with transaction processing within a day. They also offer comprehensive transaction analytics and round-the-clock customer service.\n\tGrowth and Expansion\n\tHelium Farm's optimism is buoyed by the increasing demand for decentralized wireless networks and the expansion of IoT technology. The Helium Network, particularly in regions like Miami, has seen remarkable growth with the deployment of mobile hotspots, contributing significantly to the network’s coverage and capacity.\n\tHelium Farm offers a unique opportunity for investors in the cryptocurrency mining sector. With its managed Hotspot hosting services, it caters to tailored investment plans and handles all hardware-related concerns, thereby simplifying the mining process. Their commitment to security and customer satisfaction, along with the potential for high returns, positions Helium Farm as a promising investment avenue in the HNT mining industry.\n",

The NFTs are used as a claimable and marketing tool.\n\tThe initiative was launched alongside the largest global NFT conference, NFT NYC. At the conference, some of the largest players in the NFT world show off their various products. Mintology believes there to be three reasons compelling why brands will be receptive to engaging with NFTs:\n\tMintology’s brand platform will make it viable to give away thousands of NFTs for free, something that was not previously possible due to network fees. Mintology’s platform will also eliminate the need for users to download a crypto wallet in order to participate.\n\tTo claim an NFT, all users will have to do is scan a QR code. This will direct them to a landing page where they can collect the NFT. A Facebook account or Google account can be used to authenticate, with a wallet and Mintable account automatically generated. The NFT will then appear in the wallet and account.\n\tMintology’s new platform eliminates the cost and inconvenience of the minting process by providing gas-free minting on the Ethereum mainnet. This will enable brands to give customers free NFTs by keeping costs as low as $1-2 per mint. Mintology’s Claimable NFT Platform provides a fully managed service including QR Code Scanning; Dedicated Landing Page; Hosting Solutions; Minting; Wallet Solution; Store on Mintable Marketplace.\n\tMintology is powered by Mintable, the next-generation mass market for NFTs. Mintable was the first company to pioneer gasless minting on Ethereum using its state-of-the-art technology. Users can set up an account easily on Mintology and simply pay for what they use.\n\tLearn more: https://claimable.mintology.app/\n",

This strategic financial infusion marks a pivotal moment for B² Network as it aims to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities and foster a robust ecosystem around its Layer 2 infrastructure.\n\tAt the forefront of this financial boost are esteemed entities like HashKey Capital, OKX Ventures, IDG Capital, KuCoin Ventures, ABCDE Labs, Waterdrip Capital, OGs Fund, and Antalpha Group. Their investment signifies a collective belief in B² Network's vision and the potential of Bitcoin's Layer 2 as a transformative technology in the blockchain domain.\n\tBuilding on Bitcoin’s Layer 2\n\tB² Network's unique position as the first EVM-compatible Rollup and the inaugural DA layer for Bitcoin rollups leverages zero-knowledge proof verification commitment.

This shift is expected to integrate Bitcoin more effectively into both traditional and decentralized financial systems, consequently increasing its appeal to institutional investors and the wider crypto community.\n\tEnhancing Bitcoin's Ecosystem\n\tWith the secured investments, B² Network plans to construct the most practical Bitcoin Layer 2 network, an endeavor that is not only technologically ambitious but also culturally significant. The project aims to revitalize the builder culture within the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering an environment where innovation and development are paramount.\n\tThe significance of this development can be contextualized by understanding the current landscape of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions. Recent reports from Spartan Group and Kyle Ellicott highlight the emergence of secondary networks such as Stacks, Lightning, Rootstock, and Liquid, which aim to resolve Bitcoin's scalability and functionality challenges. These networks are vital in activating Bitcoin's dormant capital, valued at over $800 billion, thereby unlocking its full potential.\n\tFurthermore, platforms like Synonym Finance, which recently raised $1.5 million in an oversubscribed seed round led by Borderless Capital, are testament to the growing interest and investment in Layer 2 solutions. Synonym Finance focuses on cross-chain DeFi lending, highlighting the diversification and potential of Layer 2 technologies.\n\tA Step Towards Mainstream Adoption\n\tB² Network's ambitious project, backed by substantial investments, is a significant stride towards enhancing Bitcoin's capabilities. By addressing key issues of scalability and functionality, B² Network is not only expanding Bitcoin's use cases but also paving the way for its increased adoption in both the traditional and decentralized finance sectors. The involvement of prominent venture capital firms further underscores the growing interest and confidence in Bitcoin's Layer 2 potential, signaling an exciting era of innovation and growth in the blockchain ecosystem.\n",

    "content": "\tChairman of Roger Holdings and prolific American investor Jim Rogers warns that the trillion-dollar bailout will lead to an economic meltdown. Another legendary Wall Street investor, George Ball predicts Bitcoin will be the safe haven of choice.\n\tJim Rogers said that the recent COVID-19 emergency stimulus programs and central bank bailouts will lead to the worst economic meltdown of his lifetime.\n\tRogers' warning came in a recent interview, where he discussed the efforts of global central banks to stimulate their respective economies through the creation of trillions of dollars in currency. Despite the stock market now going back up and appearing healthy, Rogers predicts the bailout will ultimately end very badly in the long-term.\n\tRogers sees the US markets as a bubble that will pop when the US elections are no longer a priority. He said, “Remember there is an election in the US in six months in November and all those guys want to get re-elected. They do not care about you and me and our kids. They care about November and getting re-elected. So, all sorts of good things will keep happening and the markets will be ok for a while…”\n\tLiquidity Flood Will Run Dry, Bitcoin Will Rise\n\tWhile Jim Rogers has admitted in the past that he wished he had invested in Bitcoin in its earlier days, he said during the interview the he is putting his money in gold, silver and has bet on many of the industries that took a beating during the covid-pandemic—transportation, tourism and logistics.\n\tIn a recent interview with Reuters, George Ball the former chief executive of Prudential Securities and current chairman of Sanders Morris Harris said that despite being a long time Bitcoin opponent, he now sees Bitcoin as a safe haven asset following the United States government’s efforts to continue to stimulate the economy with liquidity.\n\tBall has joined the growing list of traditional financial industry experts to advocate for Bitcoin as a safe have asset and hedge against inflation. While Ball commended the efforts of the US government and the Federal Reserve and their attempts to offset the coronavirus pandemic’s disruption to the economy, he said, “The approach of the end of that road is going to be a lot closer by the fourth quarter than it is now and therefore both traders and investors should and probably will realign their portfolios substantially.\"\n\tWhile the impending collapse and debasing of the US dollar is currently being resisted by the Federal Reserve in its attempts to go digital with its central bank digital currency development and coming FEDNow digital payments platform, the news is a bullish indicator for the Bitcoin price and Ball predicts it will kick off on September 7, 2020.\n\tThe former Prudential Securities chief executive predicts that following September 7, Labor day, a migration will \"ignite\" from traditional finance to Bitcoin trading and hedging as citizens will look to secure their wealth in an asset that cannot be \"undermined by the government.\"\n",

Heavy metals, which are carcinogens from coal ash, can leach into groundwater and contaminate waterways.\n\tStronghold Digital Mining will re-collect the coal ash from the mine after sorting and crushing. It will enter the boiler room and re-burn it to generate electricity to provide power.\n\tMining cryptos such as bitcoin requires special computer equipment to handle the intense processing power needed to get Bitcoin. Such special computers require a lot of electricity to run.\n\tThe process of Bitcoin mining has long been controversial because of its energy use and environmental impact. The amount of electricity used daily to mine Bitcoin has been identified to be more than electricity used by entire nations like Ireland.\n\tGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold, said that：\n\t\"The bitcoin mining network itself is the largest decentralized computer network in the world, and it's power hungry, so co-locating bitcoin mining and a power plant makes a lot of sense,\"\n\tLikewise, EV Battery Technologies, a blockchain and battery tech company, launched a commercial emission-free crypto mining solution dubbed Daymak Solar Tree.

We’ve gathered sufficient insights and evidence to support the case, in terms of technical as well as operational viability, for the wider implementation of the process in the organic cotton industry. In addition, the process shows enormous potential for further expansion to include other fibers in the fashion supply chain.”\n\tOrganic cotton is favored because it promotes healthy ecosystems, people, and soils. Additionally, it is a key fiber when it comes to sustainability strategies fronted by global fashion brands.\n\tOrganic cotton is also environmentally friendly because it presents a lower ecological impact because of minimal chemical usages, such as insecticides and pesticides. The blockchain pilot project will propel the adoption of organic cotton because of the traceability and transparency presented.\n",

WeChat and Alipay are wallets, while the digital yuan is the money in the wallet,” and further suggests that both wallet service providers will become useful as some users may decide to make use of them later in the future.\n\tChangchun said that the use of digital yuan is distributed through a government-owned app or a private app depending on the user.\n\tWang Leilei, a fintech consultant at Kapronasia said:\n\t“If the digital money is to be allocated through the app, some people may switch to the app, while others may transfer it to WeChat or Alipay. It depends on consumers and the use case.”\n\tWhile the DCEP is already in limited supply particularly in the city of Shenzhen wherein about 10 million (US$1.5 million) worth of digital yuan being awarded to residents, Changchun has noted the possibility for counterfeit DCEP wallets to be in circulation.\n\tThe Chinese CBDC project has progressed with the digital yuan finally being deployed to people for real-world spending. While the move has been seen by analysts as an impressive one, some of the residents of Shenzhen who got the digital yuan are actually not so impressed with the currency.\n\tAs we await the rollout of the digital yuan in other cities and provinces of China, the People’s Bank of China has drafted amendments to the extant banking laws in order to recognize the digital yuan while suppressing the emergence and circulation of any yuan pegged stablecoin that may present competition.\n",

    "content": "\tAfter many votes in favour of it, the decentralized lending protocol Compound has decided to pause the supply of four tokens used as lending assets for collateral on the platform.\n\tDue to their low liquidity in the market, Compound protocol recently set out a proposal to the community for halting four tokens, including cZRX, cBAT, cMKR, and cYFI.\n\tAccording to the Proposal, if these tokens don’t get paused, an oracle manipulation-based attack similar to the one that cost Mango Markets millions of dollars is much less likely to occur on the Compound protocol due to these tokens' much less liquidity.\n\tOverall, this proposal has received overwhelming support from the community, with approximately 554,126 votes in favour of it, representing 99.99% of the votes. Only a single voter cancelled the proposal by voting against it.\n\tThe compound protocol has now fulfilled the proposal and paused these tokens. This means the said tokens will not be available to users to deposit and/or take loans in order to protect the protocol from market manipulation attacks.\n\tCompound founder Robert Leshner, who voted in favour of the Proposal, said in an Unchained Podcast that the Mango exploits served as a wakeup call for lending protocols. Because of that, lending protocols should put it into consideration to review their risk parameters.\n\t“Every protocol has to address the risk parameters assuming that some black hat hacker is going to try to exploit it. It’s a great wake-up call for every DeFi project on every single blockchain to take this as a wake-up call,” said Leshner.\n\tThe Mango Markets hack is indeed a caution for protocols in the DeFi ecosystem to take note of. The hacker stole over $100 million from the trading and lending platform after manipulating the price of the Mango Market's native MANGO token via an oracle price manipulation attack.\n",

Bank of America announced to initiate research on this powerful digital asset system.\n\tAccording to a Bloomberg report on Monday, Candace Browning, head of global research at Bank of America Securities, said in an interview that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is now mainstream and growing.\n\t\"This isn’t just Bitcoin anymore, this is digital assets and it’s creating a whole ecosystem of new companies, new opportunities, and new applications.\"\n\tThis is the first time the Bank of America has established a digital currency research team led by Alkesh Shah as the red hot ecosystem continues to gain traction amongst all classes of investors in July this year.\n\tThe official report released on Monday by Bank of America Securities, a subsidiary of Bank of America, pointed out that the market value of the entire cryptocurrency industry has reached 2.15 trillion U.S. dollars. Such a large number makes people have to start to pay attention.\n\tAnto Paroian, Chief Operating Officer at crypto/digital assets hedge fund ARK36, said Bank of America's announcement of the launch of its digital assets research coverage is a significant bullish signal for the markets.\n\t\"it shows that the narrative of institutions buying into the digital asset space is alive and can still serve as a potential uptrend catalyst. In other words, we can still expect 'explosive' news around this subject from big market players similar to those we saw in Q1 2021; BoA is yet another mainstream financial institution to publicly hail digital assets as a new asset class. Their comment about the industry being \"too large to ignore\" should give investors confidence that digital assets are here to stay - and that they are a force to be reckoned with.\"\n\tAccording to data from Coinmarketcap, the current global crypto market cap already reached $2.18 trillion. BoA stated that the current entire digital asset ecosystem will not only include bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but will also include more digital assets and emphasized that:\n\t\"Bitcoin is important with a market value of ~$900bn, but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more: tokens that act like operating systems, decentralized applications (DApps) without middlemen, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs ) to replace national currencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabling connections between creators and fans.\"\n\tAnalysts from Bank of America believe that digital assets based on cryptocurrencies will become a new asset class in the future.\n\tThe statistics in the report show that as of June 2021, 221 million users worldwide have traded cryptocurrencies or used blockchain applications, compared with 66 million in May 2020.\n\tIn the first half of 2021 alone, global investment in blockchain/ distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrency companies has exceeded 17 billion U.S. dollars, a five-fold increase from 2019.\n\tIn addition, the research report also reminded the risk of regulatory uncertainties in the cryptocurrency field.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), a group of 31 traditional banks operating in Pakistan, has signed off on the development of a blockchain-based Know Your Customer (KYC) platform. The move aims to strengthen the country's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) capabilities while countering terror financing – an initiative led by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\n\tAs reported by the Daily Times, the PBA signed a contract on March 2 to develop Pakistan’s first blockchain-based national eKYC banking platform. The Avanza Group has been tasked to develop the blockchain-based eKYC platform named \"Consonance,\" which will be used by member banks to standardize and exchange customer data via a decentralized and self-regulated network. This will enable banks to assess existing and new customers, and to share customer details based on consent.\n\tThe member banks of PBA include international establishments such as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank. The blockchain platform will improve operational efficiencies, primarily aimed at improving customer experience during onboarding.\n\tJoining other countries in the race to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Pakistan has recently signed new laws to ensure the launch of a CBDC by 2025. The SBP will issue licenses to electronic money institutions for CBDC issuance. \"These landmark regulations are a testament to the SBP’s commitment toward openness, adoption of technology, and digitization of our financial system,\" said Deputy Governor of SBP Jameel Ahmad.\n\tThe use of blockchain technology for KYC purposes offers numerous benefits to the banking industry, including reduced costs and enhanced security. The development of Pakistan's first blockchain-based national eKYC banking platform is a significant step towards the country's digitalization of its financial system. By standardizing and sharing customer data, Pakistan's banking industry will be better equipped to fight money laundering and terror financing while improving customer experience during onboarding.\n\tOverall, the development of the blockchain-based KYC platform demonstrates the PBA's commitment to providing its members with cutting-edge technology to improve operations and customer experience. The move also reflects Pakistan's willingness to embrace blockchain technology as a means of strengthening its financial system and combatting financial crimes.\n",

It is not necessary for the participants to even have a minimum viable product (MVP) during the application stage; we will start our support from the idea. At each of the three stages of incubation, a financial subsidy is included for the startup.”\n\tThe first stage is a year-long program aptly named Science and Technology Entrepreneur Programme (STEP). Mok explained, “STEP is ultimately an idea generation which helps potential startups or even a single founder validate their business plan and theoretically confront the issues that could potentially arise in the market through assimilation training. The participants will also be advised on the government assistance schemes for which they may be eligible. Once this stage is complete, not only will the startup teams know if their idea is viable, but they will also learn what is required of them to do business in this sector. Those that qualify for incubation will enjoy a full range of tailor-made support services and facilities that will help drive their business to the next level of development.”\n\tCore incubation\n\tOnce the STEP program is completed, the participants can move to one of the three core incubation programs. Mok said, “The core programs focus more on the MVP—prototyping, commercialization, R&D and the initial market offering.” To qualify for the programs, applicants must be a Hong Kong-registered technology startup company limited by shares and established within no more than 2 years on or before the date of the application. Mok expounded, “The admissions criteria are quite broad, but we really evaluate our applicants based on four major but basic elements – the team combination; the business plan; the level of innovation and of course whether we believe the endeavor has a chance for success.”\n\tMok highlighted HKSTP’s understanding of the hard work and determination it takes to create the perfect product, application or device especially for those that plan to innovate and change the world we live in. He reiterated, “We aim to provide support every step of the way to help technology startups turn their vision into reality.”\n\tWhen technology startups are ready to take on the world stage, HKSTP offers the Leading Enterprises Acceleration Programme (LEAP) catering to their needs for global business expansion. The LEAP is designed for startups with viable market products and scalable business model. Mok said, “Upon admission, LEAP acceleratees will enjoy a wide range of world-class support and subsidies, including the support to expand their business into the Greater Bay Area (GBA) market, a cluster of 11 cities with a combined population of 65 million and GDP of USD $1.36 trillion (compared to USD $0.76 trillion for San Francisco Bay). In addition, startups can access funding up to HK$ 4.7 million for subsidies and support from fundraising, business development, and professional services.”\n\tSmart Region for a Smart City\n\tThe government of HKSAR published the Smart City Blueprint in December 2017, mapping out a development plan designed to embrace innovation and technology, enhance the effectiveness of city management and improve people’s quality of life.\n\tIn response, Hong Kong Science Park, a designated smart region living lab in the blueprint, create the ideal testbed for pushing forward the Smart City vision, leveraging the city’s attributes of dense population, efficiency, world-class ICT infrastructure, and high internet connectivity. Mok explained, “Hong Kong is a very highly developed city with a very dense population who are used to convenience. It's very difficult, to deploy and test any new technological infrastructure without causing major delays and disruption for the people.”\n\tHKSTP is often described as a ‘living laboratory’ that supports and pilots innovative solutions and fosters the adoption of new technologies. As well as providing a platform and support for innovative university research, those in the Smart Region are exposed to HKSTP’s other partners which include some of Hong Kong’s leading corporations as well as other major global entities. Mok highlighted, “We have partnered with over 63 leading corporations from Hong Kong, and globally, which allows our incubation participants and researchers under the startup scheme to meet with corporate leaders—these include organizations such as the Hong Kong Airport Authority, Cathay Pacific and TLC—fostering a collaborative platform for the technological ecosystem and the business sector as well as the sharing of ideas and the co-creation of data applications to deliver socio-economic benefits.”\n\tThe accelerating roadmap\n\tIn the future, the HKSTP will continue to strengthen its smart innovation and startup support with the introduction of various acceleration programs and corporate matching initiatives.\n\t“In the past, we were mainly focusing on helping startups in Hong Kong and linking them to corporate industry and we will continue to do so,” said Mok. “But we are also running a lot of new acceleration programs such as the IDM2 Hardware Accelerator— it is a hardware solutions program which IDM2 stands for Ideas to Design for Manufacturing and Marketing. This complements our various incubation programs as 51% of these companies come with their own hardware, so hardware acceleration is a logical next step.”\n\tAnother new initiative, the Global Acceleration Academy (GAA) aims to connect high-potential startups with world-class industry leaders and bring their innovations to the real-world marketplace. “The GAA program actually serves as a bridge for the market demands and technology at a very early stage. We go inside the corporations with access to their data. They can express their challenges and customer requirements directly to our start-ups who can create tailor-made solutions.” said Mok. “It’s actually a type of early customer engagement, we are not waiting for customers to tell us what to build, we are innovating ahead of the demand.”\n\tThe overarching goal of HKSTP is to become the technological launching pad for all of the Asia Pacific. Mok concluded, “We want the best talent from Asia. Leveraging the traditional gateway position of Hong Kong, our focus will be more on deep technology. We have a world-class research foundation for technology research, especially in the realm of biotech momentum technologies. The strides we have already made will distinguish us from most, if not all of the Asian cities, and draw in the best of best researchers globally.”\n\tPart 2 of the interview is coming up, stay tuned!\n",

    "content": "\tElon Musk, the new boss of Twitter, has again made a crypto-realted headline that has shot up prices.\n\tMusk tweeted a photo of a Shiba Inu dog dressed in a shirt with a Twitter logo and a pumpkin with a Twitter logo on Halloween day, accompanied by a wink emoji as a caption.\n\tAs expected, the prices of Musks' favourite crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu shot up.\n\tDOGE shot up 14% within minutes following his tweet. However, the crypto shrank down to 12% at press time.\n\tWhile Shiba Inu also showed a big uptrend but not as much as DOGE, it rallied by around 5% to create a local high of $0.00001032. However, Shiba Inu's uptrend also fell after the hype died down, and at press time, the pump was down to 4%. It was trading at $0.00001287.\n\tBesides the tweet, the two cryptocurrencies were already hot as Musk had already hinted that DOGE would soon be incorporated with the Twitter platform.\n\tMusk's latest tweet post comes after his completion of the acquisition of Twitter with $44 billion.\n\tMusk has been a vocal supporter of DOGE for years now. He also believes that DOGE is better than bitcoin for executing daily crypto payments.\n\tMusk's crypto-related tweets have always been market movers.\n\tDOGE also previously shot up in May when Musk tweeted that in the near future, his space venture company SpaceX would introduce payments with DOGE.\n\tBloomberg media on Saturday suggested several ways that Musk, who is one of the most significant crypto influencers globally, might bring more cryptocurrency into Twitter.\n\tAccording to Bloomberg, if Musk decided to play a bigger crypto role on Twitter, there are some ways he could do it.\n\tBots and spam on Twitter have been a huge concern for Musk and helped trigger a contentious legal battle that put his acquisition of the firm at risk. The issue is particularly important in cryptocurrency, where spam accounts impersonate famous personalities like Musk in order to promote scams involving fake crypto giveaways.\n\tAccording to Bloomberg, some crypto enthusiasts believe that Musk may advocate for the use of blockchain to help reduce bots on Twitter and authenticate all real humans on social media.\n\tFreedom of speech is a priority for Musk, and he intends to lift the company’s lifelong bans on users. Those values align with those of most crypto believers dedicated to the ethos of the decentralization promoted by blockchain.\n\tAs per Bloomberg, Musk could potentially implement a token-based voting system that allows users to have more say over what occurs on Twitter. He also could add more crypto elements on Twitter to expand decentralization aspects and mainstream usage of digital assets.\n\tMusk has already expressed ambitions of turning Twitter into a “super app.” In the past, he expressed admiration for China’s WeChat platform, which can handle things like messaging, games, payments, and video streaming.\n",

    "time": "2019-12-06",
    "author": "Lucas Cacioli",
    "content": "\tDr. Ben Goertzel is the founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a decentralized blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) marketplace project. He has described the project as a medium for the creation and the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as well as a way to roll out superior AI-as-a-service to every vertical market and enable everyone in the world to contribute to and benefit from AI.\n\tBlockchain.News managed to catch up with Dr. Goertzel at the Blockshow 2019, in Singapore. In the first part of our interview, we discuss the evolution and the philosophical aspects of AI and AGI.\n\tEvolution of Artificial Intelligence\n\tFor many, the concept of machines with the ability to learn and develop as humans, but with the enhanced calculation speed of a computer, is simply terrifying. Will the machines replace us, will we be able to contain them, or will we merge with them and how far away is this future?\n\tWhile AI does describe the simulation of human intelligence by machines, most AI we encounter in our day to day lives are complex mathematical algorithms, such as Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, described as ‘narrow AI’ and are of relatively weak intelligence—capable of performing basic tasks but only within a very specific framework.\n\tGoertzel is aiming higher, essentially trying to birth a much stronger type of AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems with assimilated human learning cognitive abilities. He explained, “AGI refers to an AI that can generalize way beyond what it has been taught and has seen, which means it can imaginatively guess elements about new domains of experience. This is extremely important in the modern world where we are forced to deal with unexpected circumstances all the time.”\n\tBeyond AGI is where things get really exciting and may perhaps present a slightly existential challenge for humanity—artificial superintelligence (ASI). Goertzel said, “Artificial superintelligence is the next step beyond general intelligence. Humans currently have more general intelligence than the software products that are commercially available right now. But humans are by no means the most generally intelligent possible system. I think as AI advances further and further, you're going to see AI as tremendously smarter than people much as we're much smarter than monkeys, rats, or bugs. But I mean, to get from where we are now with narrow AI, to AGI, and then to artificial superintelligence, we need to go through quite a series of practical steps.” He continued, “That's really what we're engaged with at SingularityNET—the project is how to get through the next steps of the evolution—from where we are now, with fairly simplistic narrow AI towards a powerful general intelligence but also taking care to do it in a way that avoids putting the AI in control of these confused centralized global powerful parties—we want a decentralized general intelligence.\"\n\tThe Singularity in SingularityNET\n\tAs Dr. Goertzel revealed, “The singularity in SingularityNET refers to the future foreseen by Verner Vinge and popularized by Ray Kurzweil—it basically is the moment at which technology starts advancing so fast, it seems effectively instantaneous to the human mind, and this is going to occur by AGI becoming smarter than people. AI will be doing the invention rather than people.”\n\tShortly before his death, at a conference in Lisbon, Stephen Hawking warned those in attendance that the development of artificial intelligence might become the “worst event in the history of our civilization.” He was alluding to what is known as the ‘technological singularity.’ Other notable intellectuals of our time including Tesla’s Elon Musk and neuroscientist Sam Harris have also delivered a number of foreboding speeches regarding the innovation, believing it may be the start of our impending doom and will ultimately replace us completely or even worse—simply discard us in the course of an intermediary task as HAL 9000 discarded the lives of the astronauts in favor of completing the mission of the Discovery One.\n\tGoertzel does not share this apocalyptic view but sees an opportunity for humans and machines to evolve together, he said, “AI will almost certainly become far more intelligent than human beings. But there will be a possibility for humans to follow the AI along and effectively fuse their minds with the AI—which Elon Musk, among others, are also working on with his company Neuralink. I would say humans who choose not to fuse with the AI will indeed be, in a sense, left behind as they will no longer be among the smartest beings in this region of the universe.”\n\tArtificial Compassion for Humanity\n\tThe fact that AI will become much smarter than people do not necessarily mean that AI is a danger to humans. Goertzel explained, “That all depends on how they are built, what we want is AIs that are compassionately disposed toward human beings. That is also why at SingularityNET we're so focused on creating a democratically controlled AI mind because if the first true general intelligence is controlled by a military organization or an advertising agency, then this probably isn't optimal in terms of gathering a beneficial general intelligence to emerge into a compassionate, supermind.”\n\tSo how do you put compassion into a machine? How can you teach an AI about empathy and concepts as abstract as love? The reality is that even as humans, we are unable to display or enact these concepts with any real consistency. Goertzel said, “You don’t program empathy into the code of the AI; these things will be learned by the AI. Compassion will emerge within the AI in the course of its interactions with the world—including the humans in the world and the physical world. It’s very similar to a child, you don’t program emotions or compassion into a child; they gain it through interactions with the world.” He added, “So the task of AI is to build a learning system and a self-organizing system that can organize its own mind; its own feelings; and its own compassion in an appropriate way. It is complex, but the internet is complex, your mobile phone is complex, your laptop is complex, I mean, humanity has built many complex things, and these are built by a combination of many complex people working together.”\n\tAt the comparison of an AI developing as a child would, I could not help but consider the amount of children that grow up to be sociopathic—often making impulsive decisions or breaking rules with little or no feelings of guilt or wrongdoing. Goertzel admits, “Humanity is certainly a complex mess with aspects that are both positive and negative according to the value systems of various parts of humanity. I think the best we can do is put an AI out there in the world and expose it to the various aspects of humanity and make sure that it's biased in a positive direction.”\n\tGoertzel himself is a father of four children and a grandfather to one, speaking from experience he said, “Protecting them from all the bad things in the world is something you can only do to a limited extent because eventually, they're going to go out there and interact with some harsh realities—but you can bias what you expose them to in a positive direction.”\n\tThe reality of our future according to Goertzel, is that AGI is coming regardless and what we can do is ensure that it is not solely disposed towards the whims of a powerful central authority and that it is taught compassion for humanity. He said, “AI will be used for military purposes, it will be used for advertising and even crime. We have to make sure that AI is also used, and to a greater extent, for education, agriculture, healthcare or scientific discovery. The AI will get all these things integrated into its mind and be able to form a whole picture of human values and culture to form a substantial inclination towards compassion.”\n\tSum of Many\n\tGoertzel clarified that the creation of the future AGI global intelligence will not be done solely by his team at SingularityNET, it will be the combined work of a vast community of AI and technology developers as well as the information that the AI agents on the network are able to absorb from human consumers who leverage the network.\n\tHe said, “If Singularity is going to play a key role, then we need to be massively growing the user base of SingularityNET—we have to drive massive adoption of these decentralized networks that we have launched. After two years of work, we have a pretty nice version of the SingularityNET platform out there. It's a decentralized network which is democratically governed and controlled—meaning the AI network is sort of controlled by the AI agents in the network, rather than by some outside party. It's a nice bit of software and we’ve shown it works.” Concluding he said, “If humanity wants to transition from AI to AGI and then to super intelligence in a democratic and participatory way then networks like SingularityNET need to be a significant part of the mix, which is easy to see from an abstract view but from practice on the ground, there's still a lot to be done to get adoption of this sort of platform.”\n",

    "author": "Rebeca Moen",
    "content": "\tPublicly-listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Argo Blockchain has reported an increase in its daily Bitcoin production for the month of February, despite a significant spike in network difficulty. According to the operational update released on March 7, Argo mined 162 Bitcoin or BTC equivalents during the month, translating to a daily production rate of 5.7 BTC. This is a 7% increase from the 5.4 BTC per day produced in January.\n\tBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure that defines how hard it is to mine a BTC block. It requires more hash rate or additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins. In February, the BTC network difficulty surged to new all-time highs, hitting a difficulty rate of 43 trillion on Feb. 25, as per data from Blockchain.com.\n\tDespite the network difficulty spike, Argo's production rate has increased, thanks to the company's investment in new mining equipment and a focus on increasing efficiency. The news comes amid the industry anticipating the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment expected to occur on March 10. According to data from BTC.com, the next difficulty is estimated to reach 43.4 trillion.\n\tArgo Blockchain sold its flagship mining facility Helios to Mike Novogratz's crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital amid the tough crypto market of 2022. However, despite the sale, Argo has continued to mine using Galaxy's facility, and its production rate has been steadily increasing. Months before the transaction, Argo's monthly BTC mining generated more than 200 BTC.\n\tArgo is not the only mining firm that seems unaffected by the BTC difficulty spike in February. Other miners like Cipher Mining produced 16% more Bitcoin over January, and Marathon Digital increased its average daily Bitcoin produced by 10% compared to January. However, Hut 8 mining firm saw its daily Bitcoin production rate drop from 6 BTC in January to 5.6 BTC in February.\n\tArgo Blockchain has been focusing on expanding its operations to capitalize on the increasing demand for Bitcoin mining services. The company recently announced plans to establish a Bitcoin mining facility in West Texas, which is expected to have a capacity of up to 200 megawatts and is slated to begin operations in Q4 2022.\n\tIn conclusion, despite the network difficulty spike, Argo Blockchain's focus on increasing efficiency and investment in new equipment has led to an increase in its daily Bitcoin production rate. The company's expansion plans and investment in new facilities suggest that it is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin mining services.\n",

    "time": "2020-10-28",
    "author": "Lucas Cacioli",
    "content": "\tAjay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard believes Bitcoin is unable to function as an inclusive currency for the world’s unbanked as the cryptocurrency is too volatile and lacks transparency.\n\tThe CEO of payments giant Mastercard believes that central bank digital currencies (CBDC) will be far better suited to drive financial inclusion than, Bitcoin which he say is still too volatile.\n\tSpeaking at the Fortune Global Forum on Oct 27, Mastercard’s CEO said that Bitcoin’s lack of transparency in its origins was a concern along with its extreme volatility make it unsuitable for empowering the unbanked. However, the CEO said that central bank digital currencies are a different story.\n\tRegarding Bitcoin, Banga said:\n\t“I am not a believer in the volatility or, for that matter, the absence of transparency in who is the person who’s involved with that currency. So, that’s why central bank digital currencies, we’re believers in.”\n\tThe Mastercard CEO also revealed that the payment giant has a large library of patents relating to CBDC. In addition, it was also announced in September that Mastercard has launched a virtual testing platform to allow central banks to evaluate use cases and test roll-out strategies for CBDCs by simulating a CBDC ecosystem.\n\tBitcoin remains of the table as a potential solution to financial inclusion as far as Banga is concerned. The Mastercard CEO claimed that the landmark cryptocurrency value was too unstable, and gave a crude example of BTC’s price volatility pertaining to how much coca-cola one could buy changing from one day to the next.\n\tThe Mastercard CEO explained:\n\t\"Can you imagine someone who is financially excluded trading in a way to get included through a currency that could cost the equivalent of two Coca-Cola bottles today and 21 tomorrow? That's not a way to get them [included]. That's a way to make them scared of the financial system.\"\n\tBanga reiterated that a digital version of sovereign digital currencies would be much better suited to help with cross-border finance.\n\tMastercard’s CEO Banga has not ever been known as a fan of cryptocurrency or their lack of regulation and transparency and was reported as calling Bitcoin and crypto “junk” in 2018 by the Times of India—stating that crypto should not be considered a medium of exchange.\n\tHowever, Mastercard has shown public support for digital fiat currency. In 2019, Senior MasterCard executive Ari Sarker told the Financial Times that if governments look to create national digital currency the payment’s giant would be very happy to look at those more favorably than cryptocurrency. Sarker said at the time:\n\t“So long as it’s backed by a regulator and the value . . . it is not anonymous, it is meeting all the regulatory requirements, I think that would be of greater interest for us to explore.”\n\tMastercard Holistic Approach to Digital Currency\n\tDespite Banga’s reported hostility towards cryptocurrency—in September 2020, Mastercard’s Blockchain and Digital Assets Lead for the Asia Pacific, Ashok Venkateswaran told Blockchain.News that Mastercard is taking a “holistic” approach to digital currencies. The payment giant is looking at everything from central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin, as well as stable coin options.\n\tAfter revealing that Mastercard has over 90 blockchain-specific patents—the Venkateswaran said that as one of the most recognizable payment systems on earth, despite its interest, Mastercard works with regulation and many for crypto, the regulations have not yet been in place.\n\tAn important way to increase adoption of new payment technologies and digital currencies in the mainstream, according to Venkateswaran is by changing the regulatory environment:\n\t“Regulations are still trying to catch up to a lot of these things. We’re following the regulatory principles, but also trying to see how we can help some of those regulations get formed … As one of the largest networks in the world, we want to make sure that we can support any kind of transaction.”\n",

He points out, \"Given the Nature of crypto Investments, I recognize that it may be appropriate to be flexible in existing disclosure requirements.\"\n\tFor cryptocurrency intermediaries, Gensler said it may need to register with both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in one day to become dual registrants.\n\tGensler said a level playing field is essential if cryptocurrencies are to continue to grow. On additional regulation, the chairman said the SEC will look at all aspects to ensure that regulation does not stifle the market.\n",

    "time": "2021-01-11",
    "author": "News Publisher",
    "content": "\tSwitzerland’s reputation as the most business-friendly country for blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) ventures has cemented its role in fostering the development of global applications for tokenized economies – and global companies such as Dfinity and Diem have flocked to its borders and now call it home.\n\tKnown for its bottom-up, decentralized economic and political environment, Switzerland offers the ideal ecosystem for disruptive technologies. It has led the way with cryptocurrencies by creating the first regulatory body in the world to establish clear guidelines for ICOs and classifications for tokens, in addition to many other landmark legislative moves to ensure the success of cryptocurrency and DLT companies.\n\tIn January 2021 Switzerland will introduce a new license type for trading venues focusing on digital assets (DLT Trading Facilities), creating a clearer and lighter regulatory regime. A DLT Trading Facility is a new form of license for security tokens and other forms of digital assets. This legislation also provides a new license for “Uncertified Registered Securities” to stabilize the uncertainty surrounding civil law treatment of security tokens.\n\tThe Swiss regulatory bodies also recognized that to meet the expected needs of fintech start-ups and larger players alike, the DLT Trading Facility License can be applied for in two versions: A smaller, leaner license with lower requirements as well as a more comprehensive license type for higher transaction volumes.\n\t[Source: MME Legal | Tax | Compliance]\n\tThe country’s clearly defined tax schemes for blockchain and DLT companies, access to an established ecosystem of service providers with expertise in the blockchain industry, such as law firms, banks, and tax regulation experts, create a supportive business environment. Switzerland’s long tradition in the fintech and the financial sector – and with its thriving “Crypto Valley” – will continue to be the choice of both startups and established global players building new applications for a tokenized economy.\n\tAs the global headquarters of the newly renamed Diem Association – formerly known as Facebook’s Libra – Switzerland will see the birth of the stablecoin Diem Dollar as soon as regulatory approval is granted by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), it is expected to be approved sometime in January.\n\tSwitzerland ranked number one of the ten most blockchain-friendly countries in Europe [Source: BlockShow Europe 2019].\n\tAn unparalleled brain trust: crypto-friendly research and educational institutions\n\tOne of the reasons both U.S. and global crypto and DLT companies flock to Switzerland is due to the unparalleled access to an educated and diverse talent pool made possible by the country’s federal institutes of learning and a two-tiered educational system.\n\tThe first university professorship in blockchain was created at the University of Basel in 2018 and the two federal science and technology institutes in Lausanne and Zurich have been recognized as global leaders in crypto education [Source: Coinbase, 2019].\n\tWorld-renowned institutes committed to DLT and blockchain advances assure access to a highly educated and skilled workforce prepared for the explosive growth in cryptocurrency, DeFi, and blockchain in the 2020s.\n\tThe Blockchain Center at the University of Zurich has become the most active academic cluster in Switzerland. It is led by 22 professors who work to investigate blockchain topics from a multidisciplinary perspective.\n\tThe remarkable body of research institutions and educational programs devoted to DLT and blockchain technologies are unmatched in the world and make Switzerland an attractive choice for EMEA headquarters and research facilities for crypto companies.\n\tAn innovation-friendly regulatory network by design\n\tFINMA’s introduction of unsupervised sandbox regimes in 2017 allowed young fintech startups to grow by not requiring a banking license to accept deposits from the public if certain criteria are met. Rather than stifling innovation, young companies have the freedom to explore and develop before they become regulated.\n\tWith clear metrics and guidelines once they approach “bank-like” status, these promising start-ups then apply and are integrated into the regulatory structure. Since 2019, companies who obtain a fintech license have been able to accept public deposits of up to 100 million Swiss francs, greatly simplifying blockchain and crypto companies’ access to the Swiss market.\n\tThe innovative sandbox regime introduced only three years ago has had a dramatic effect on the number of fintech and crypto startups that flock to Switzerland. To date, Switzerland boasts:\n\t● The first regulated crypto banks, SEBA and Sygnum\n\t● 842 blockchain-related companies\n\t● These companies employ over 4,400 employees\n\t● This environment has birthed five unicorns: Ethereum, Dfinity, Polkadot, Bitmain, and Diem, with more anticipated.\n\t[Source: CV VC Top 50 Report H2/2019]\n\tA legacy of firsts in the cryptocurrency ecosystem\n\tThe city of Zug was the first state authority in the world to accept Bitcoin as an official means of payment, thus the birth of Switzerland’s “Crypto Valley.” Zug also saw the creation of Ethereum, an open-source platform for decentralized applications resulting in the second most significant cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin.\n\tThe success of Ethereum helped create a global ecosystem that stretches from German speaking Zurich, Basel, Lucerne and Bern to French speaking Geneva, Neuchatel and Lausanne as well as Ticino, Switzerland's Italian speaking region, each with its own approach and expertise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\tIn 2018, Switzerland’s regulatory body, FINMA, became the first regulator in the world to publish clear guidelines on ICOs and classifications for tokens. Later that year, the Geneva cantonal authorities released the very first guide dedicated to supporting ICO project promoters.\n\tA favorable legislative and tax system for the decade of crypto and blockchain\n\tIn June 2020, Swiss authorities passed a legislative package impacting around a dozen financial laws which brought favorable changes to the blockchain and DLT sector while at the same time, leaving untouched, the respective tax laws which were already seen as highly favorable to this emerging sector.\n\tIn 2019, funding of the top 50 Crypto Valley companies totaled US$7.8 billion, and US$3.7 billion for H12020 [Source: CVVC Insights]. As Swiss companies thrive, U.S. companies such as 21Shares, IBM (whose R&D lab was established in Zurich in 1956), and the aforementioned unicorns Dfinity and Diem, reap the benefits of this crypto sandbox.\n\tSwitzerland’s newest kid on the block, Diem, plans to develop policies for sanctions compliance and to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, all of huge concern to regulators and Western governments [Source: VentureBeat, 2020].\n\tCrypto and DLT companies looking to put their growth trajectory into hyperdrive should consider the market access advantages Switzerland offers as the 2020s become the decade of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.\n\tChristoph Besmer is the Trade Commissioner for Switzerland and Head of Investment of the Swiss Business Hub USA.

According to Wang, OneKey has overtaken custody of billions of dollars in crypto assets. He also believes that the firm continues to grow rapidly without \"incomplete 3rd-party statistics.\"\n\tWang has also revealed - citing data from the firm's shipped orders - that rival wallet maker Ledger and crypto firms Alchemy and Infura are using OneKey's devices.\n\tCurrently, there are around 30 people working for OneKey and the wallet maker has no plans to increase that number. \"OneKey is very conscious of controlling the burn rate and prioritizing long-term profitability,\" Wang said.

    "author": "Blockchain.News Marketing",
    "content": "\tSingapore, Singapore, 24th November, 2022, Chainwire\n\tBinaryX has confirmed that it is working on a new free-to-play, play-to-own game, CyberLand, an open-world MMO powered by blockchain technology. The team just released the concept video which gives a first look of the terrains and features of the game.\n\tFree-to-play, Play-to-Own\n\tCyberLand marks BinaryX’s official transition away from play-to-earn models, and is their first-ever play-to-own game in the metaverse. As a play-to-own game, players have a high degree of freedom in resource production. Players can choose to develop their own assets, construct their own buildings and farm their own products and materials to build their empire. These assets can also be fully traded on the open market.\n\tThe team wanted to make a game that is not only visually impressive and entertaining to play, but also lets players create value incrementally, so that players can feel a greater sense of ownership and be able to enjoy the game for much longer than the typical Web3 games.\n\tThe Story of CyberLand\n\tThe player’s journey in the game begins in a pristine open world with rich natural resources. The player must then explore the vast lands to find resources, invent technologies and develop their land to survive, and eventually build an empire. The game is similar to traditional 4X strategy games. Players get to write their own stories and determine their own fate within the game.\n\tPlayers will face off against dangerous monsters within the lands. The stronger the monsters, the more precious the resources. Players must fend against the threat of monsters while collecting resources.\n\tThe Four Lands of CyberLand\n\tCyberLand currently consists of four terrains: snowfield, plains, desert, and swamps. Each type of land has its own unique resources and is guarded by different monsters. The resources are not known to the player at the beginning of the game, and it is up to the player to search, mine or hunt their own resources. The name of the game is asset ownership, which means that the player gets to own the land that they purchase as an NFT.\n\t100% Player Driven, Off-chain Trading Economy\n\tThe game consists of an in-game trading marketplace which is completely off-chain. All transactions of in-game resources can be completed within the game without incurring any gas fees. They can also be transferred to on-chain assets and can be traded on DEXes and CEXes respectively.\n\tThe marketplace is also completely player-driven, which means players can trade their land on the marketplace, and determine prices of land and resources by selling the goods they produce from their land in the marketplace. The game also mimics the actual trading economy in a peer-to-peer marketplace, where the supply and demand of resources being sold on the market directly affect the prices of resources in the marketplace.\n\tCyberLand will use $BNX as the main native currency. $BNX can be used in the game for buying land, or as a reward from player participation in leaderboard competitions.\n\tUpcoming Features\n\tIn preparation for the beta release, the BinaryX team is working on developing more cool features for the game, including introducing SocialFi features where players can create, manage, and upload monetized content on a shared network while expanding their empire.\n\tThe team is also working on an on-chain wallet for seamless cryptocurrency transactions within the game, and designing new playable areas and maps for future DLC releases.\n\tWatch the concept video here\n\tAbout BinaryX\n\tBinaryX is the GameFi platform behind play-to-earn games CyberDragon and CyberChess, both of which run on the BNB chain.\n\tBinaryX began as a decentralised derivative trading system. The team gradually evolved into developing decentralised video games, and is now transitioning to becoming a GameFi platform offering IGO services to bridge Web2 developers to Web3.\n\tAs one of the top 10 projects on the BNB Chain, BinaryX has a vast community of more than 100k coin holders and 17K monthly active wallets. It is also one of the largest metaverse projects by trading volume on the BNB chain, with more than 400 million in market cap. BinaryX also has a token, $BNX, that has consistently demonstrated strong performance despite the bear market.\n\tFor more details and information about BinaryX, please visit www.binaryx.pro\n\tBinaryX whitepaper\n\tAbout BinaryX deck\n\tFind us on social media: BinaryX | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | YouTube | Medium\n",

    "content": "\tWeMade, a South Korean Web3 game developer, has emphatically denied allegations of coin over-issuance fraud. These accusations were brought forward by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office, which has been investigating the company for potentially circumventing regulations and making unfair profits. WeMade's defense centers around its digital asset storage system and decentralized exchange, Phoenix DEX, claiming they are exempt from compliance requirements that mandate registration with authorities for virtual asset service providers.\n\tThe company argues that its services, including the Play Wallet and PNIX DEX, operate outside the regulatory framework requiring control over user assets via private keys. WeMade maintains that its wallet services are decentralized, asserting that it does not control personal encryption keys and, therefore, is not engaged in activities necessitating regulatory reporting for virtual asset transfer, storage, or exchange.\n\tThis ongoing investigation has put WeMade under considerable scrutiny, given its pivotal role in the Web3 and blockchain gaming sectors. Notably, WeMade is renowned for its Legend of Mir series and had ambitious plans for integrating blockchain technology into its gaming ecosystem. The company's strategy notably includes the WEMIX token and the development of a blockchain mainnet aimed at supporting play-to-earn (P2E) functionalities across a wide range of games.\n\tWeMade's challenges have been compounded by previous controversies, including issues leading to the delisting of WEMIX tokens from major South Korean crypto exchanges. Allegations of unauthorized fund liquidation and fraudulent disclosure practices have been significant factors in these developments.\n\tDespite these hurdles, WeMade has expressed its intention to continue challenging what it perceives as unjust treatment by regulatory bodies and certain market participants. The company has taken legal steps, including appealing court decisions and filing complaints with regulatory authorities, to fight for its vision of integrating blockchain technology into the gaming industry.\n",

    "content": "\tAccording to the latest report from Glassnode, institutions and investors holding a large amount of Bitcoin reduced their holdings by 140,000 Bitcoins in February, which is equivalent to a reduction of 67.2 tenths since the beginning of this month.\n\tThe \"giant whale\" reduced its holdings\n\tGlassnode defines addresses holding 1k-10k bitcoins as \"whales\", while those holding more than 10,000 Bitcoins are called \"humpback whales.\"\n\tAs seen from the following second figure and the green line, since February 5, investors holding addresses with a balance of 1k-10k have sold off their Bitcoins before the price plummeted at the end of the week in order to make a profit.\n\tThe fall in the U.S. unemployment rate\n\tAccording to data from the U.S. Labor Department, the unemployment rate in the United States in January 2021 is 6.3%, a slight improvement from the previous unemployment rate of 6.7% in December 2020. In the United States, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits for the first time last week was 730,000, close to the lowest level since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, and lower than market expectations of 825,000. The number was revised up to 861,000 last week. This news stimulated the market’s future recovery and a slight improvement in the U.S. economy. This phenomenon may serve to explain the temporary decline experienced by the cryptocurrency market.\n\tThe rise in the U.S. Treasury rate\n\tAt the same time, due to market expectations that the national vaccines plan and future fiscal stimulus measures will stimulate economic growth, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond price has plummeted. The U.S. Treasury bond yield rose strongly by 1.614% to hit the highest value since February 14, 2020.The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rose to 2.323%. The US 5-year Treasury bond yield hit 0.862%, the highest level since March 3 last year.\n\tBecause of the optimistic view of the future economy, the rise in the Treasury bond rate means that the Fed will implement a tightening in policy, and investors will be more inclined to invest funds in the bond market to obtain stable and high returns. This has caused violent fluctuations in the stock market and the crypto market.\n\tBTC market analysis\n\tFrom the four-hour candlesticks of BTC, Bitcoin has continued to plummet since February 21. At the time of writing, the price of BTC has fallen by approximately 24.52%. Despite a short-term rise on February 24 and February 25, which pulled the Bitcoin price up to the $50,000 level, the upper-pressure level of about $51,000 is being suppressed strongly. BTC/USD has been tested many times, and it has not succeeded in breaking the $51,000 level, indicating that the resistance above $51,000 is relatively large. If the bulls do not have a strong upside, it is impossible to stand firm. The recent 4-hour candlesticks have fallen below the support level of the previously drawn-up ascending channel and the power of bulls failed to surpass the power of bears. In the short term, the BTC price will likely correct to around $40,000.\n\tFrom a technical point of view, the Bollinger Band is slowly shrinking. On Feb 25, the blue MACD line briefly surpassed the yellow signal line below the zero axes. This was a normal trend that there would be a short-term rebound after the currency price plummeted. Then the MACD line(blue) crossed the signal line(yellow) from top to bottom, formed a death cross with a constantly increasing opening amplitude. This helps confirm the formation of a short-term bearish market.\n",

    "title": "Bitcoin Halving: Everything You Need to Know in 5 Minutes",
    "time": "2020-05-07",
    "author": "Matthew Lam",
    "content": "\tBitcoin Halving: What and Why\n\tIn May 2020, Bitcoin is expected to experience its third halving in history. Bitcoin halving refers to the halving of Bitcoin block rewards, which occurs once every 210,000 blocks created (approximately every 4 years). Block reward refers to the amount of Bitcoin received by miners after they successfully validate a new block.\n\tThe rationale of Bitcoin halving stems from the currency design of Bitcoin. In the email thread between Satoshi Nakamoto and Mike Hearn, Nakamoto suggested that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. This is opposite to the inflationary nature of fiat currencies in which their supply is controlled by central banks.\n\tIt is expected that all Bitcoins will be mined approximately by the year 2140 based on the following protocol design of Bitcoin:\n\t1) The target of 10-minute block intervals;\n\t2) Bitcoin halving mechanism; and\n\t3) Block reward starts with 50 and reaches 0 after continuous halving events.\n\tWhen Bitcoins in circulation reach its maximum supply, miners will no longer receive block rewards and only receive transaction fees from users as rewards. It is noteworthy that Bitcoin’s maximum supply can be changed if the changes are approved by the economic majority.\n\tImplication of Past Bitcoin Halvings\n\tBitcoin block rewards started with 50 since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin experienced two halvings in 2012 and 2016 which the current block reward is 12.5 BTC. The block reward will be halved as 6.25 BTC after the third halving.\n\tWhat does Bitcoin halving mean for traders, miners and mining manufacturers?\n\tTraders\n\tThe past Bitcoin halvings have been indicated as a positive signal to Bitcoin price. In theory, assuming Bitcoin demand stays constant, as each Bitcoin halving slows down the issuance of Bitcoin, Bitcoin in circulation will become scarcer over time and the scarcity drives up the Bitcoin price.\n\tThe Bitcoin community was unaware of the impact brought by the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, and the Bitcoin price rose almost 80x a year after (See Figure 4). The 2016 Bitcoin halving was highly anticipated by the community and the price rise was less substantial than the first halving.\n\tThe impact of third Bitcoin halving on price is uncertain as it can be driven by the following factors (See Figure 6).\n\tMiners\n\tMiners will receive 50% less Bitcoin block rewards after each halving. From the previous Bitcoin halvings, Bitcoin hashrate and mining profitability resulted in an initial drop and recover after a few months (See Figures 7 and 8).\n\tThe hash rate of Bitcoin hovers near all-time high (123.28m TH/S) and currently stands at 119.472m TH/S. Network difficulty increased 1.4% on May 5 and reached 16.105 t. For the third Bitcoin halving, Bitmex predicted that the hashrate may decline by 30-35% after the halving.\n\tMining Manufacturers\n\tMining manufacturers usually release new mining models ahead of Bitcoin halving, which improved efficiency enables miners to optimize their earnings. For example, Bitmain announced a new Antminer S19 and S19 pro in February. As the main competitor of Bitmain, Canaan Creative announced its Bitcoin miner Avalonminer A10 in late March.\n",

    "content": "\tArgo Blockchain plc, a major global cryptocurrency mining firm, announced Thursday an update of its business operations for June 2022.\n\tArgo said it mined 179 Bitcoins in June compared to 124 BTC in May 2022. The firm said the rise in Bitcoins mined during June is primarily because of an increase in total hashrate capacity and greater uptime at its Helios mining facility compared to May.\n\tThe firm stated that its mining revenue generated in June amounted to $4.35 million compared to $3.89 million in May.\n\tThis means that in the previous month, Argo's mining revenue increased by 10% to £3.38 million ($4.35 million) as the firm produced 46% more Bitcoin than in May because of higher uptime and increased hashrate.\n\tThe better performance was achieved as the firm shipped in and installed more S19J Pro machines from Bitmain, a commitment that keeps the Argo on track to install all 20,000 machines as agreed with Bitmain.\n\tPeter Wall, Argo CEO, talked about the development: \"Ongoing efforts to significantly upscale Argo's mining operations are reflected in this month's numbers and our increased hashrate,\" adding that \"These numbers, along with our continued installations of the S19J Pro machines, put us in a solid position with regards to our mining capacity. We believe the company is well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions and further increase our efficiencies.\"\n\tArgo mentioned it generated the profit at a time when Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin stood at 50% during June, compared to May's 55%. The decrease in mining margin was majorly driven by the reduced Bitcoin prices and higher electricity costs at its Helios facility in Texas.\n\tAs of June 30, Argo said it held 1,953 Bitcoins, out of which 210 were BTC Equivalents.\n\tBesides that, the Bitcoin miner further disclosed that it hired an in-house derivative trader in June to help better navigate the extreme market conditions that have seen Bitcoin drastically plunge its price.\n\tArgo mentioned that it has been using derivatives to reduce downside risk since October last year. The firm said it hired a full-time in-house derivative trader last month to improve the company's capabilities within risks and treasury management.\n\tArgo also disclosed that it sold 637 BTC at an average price of $24,500 in June in order to pay for operating expenses and a BTC-backed loan from Galaxy Digital.\n\tAt the end of last month, Argo said it had an outstanding $22 million balance loan with Galaxy Digital. In December last year, Argo signed the $30 million loan collateralized by Bitcoin.\n\tArgo said that with the outstanding loan balance standing at $22 million, it is confident that it has adequate liquidity to avoid any potential liquidations of the BTC-backed loan in case Bitcoin prices continue dropping.\n",

    "content": "\tWithin the first quarter of 2021, the cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in the retail and institutional sectors and their adoption of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the world's most valuable and widely traded cryptocurrency, reached an all-time high of $56 445 per bitcoin on the 22nd of February 2021. There is no doubt that the word ‘cryptocurrency’ is receiving more airtime than ever before. Extremely well-respected CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, announced they invested 1.5 billion USD in Bitcoin in early February. This has since led to a rapid gain of momentum and trust in the cryptocurrency market, driving the price in a positive direction ever since.\n\t2020 proved to be one of the toughest financial years, with the global coronavirus pandemic impacting economies worldwide and bringing daily life to a grinding halt. Despite many industries struggling immensely, the cryptocurrency market one could say ‘mooned’, with the total market capitalization increasing by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on the 1st of January 2020 was at a mere $190 billion USD. Since then, we have seen an overall increase of roughly 720%, reaching a total market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion USD to date. This resulted in more than a 1.3 trillion USD increase in just over one year.\n\tWith this worldwide cryptocurrency adoption, many wonder if they should enter the realm of crypto assets too? There are currently around 8 509 cryptocurrencies available, therefore choosing how you want to enter this volatile market is proving to be a difficult choice for many. Invictus Capital has since introduced the Crypto10 Hedged fund (C10) in March 2019. C10 provides investors with exposure to the top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. This fund aims to choose a basket of crypto assets to diversify your risk even further. Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of directly in the market will be a more attractive option for many investors, especially those entering the market for the first time, because using a vehicle run by seasoned management is probably safer than direct market participation.\n\tSince its inception, this fund has gained immense popularity due to its unique cash hedging option, and we have seen a total performance to date of a 420% increase in value in under 2 years. This fund has been an excellent diversification tool aimed at risk-averse investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market and be somewhat protected from full exposure.\n\tC10 is an actively managed fund, using a cash hedging algorithm that converts the assets to cash in times of market distress. The fund will then re-invest the cash when the opportunity arises, and the market has somewhat recovered. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an increasing trend of investments into the C10 fund, with the Fund Value reaching new heights of above $9.4 million and a C10 token NAV (Net Asset Value) of $5.135.\n\tThese tremendous results are a direct representation of the fund’s brilliant performance in a highly volatile market and the effectiveness of the fund's algorithm. Due to the extremely competitive nature of the crypto market to date, C10 aims to ride the bull market and offer high returns to investors with an added “insurance policy” as a hedge, providing a lower risk investment. With a market that is scaling at a rapid pace, reaching new standards daily, and with so much future potential, Crypto 10 Hedged is one of the best investment tools on the market. Given the history of C10, the hedging algorithm unquestionably equip’s investors in this unpredictable market.\n",

While many more, operating under exemptions, face an uncertain future.\n\tSingapore's introduction of the licensing regime in January this year was put forward as the next step in building a booming crypto sector and providing equal opportunities for all.\n\tWhile the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) supports innovation in the use of blockchain technology, which includes cryptocurrencies, it also recognizes the risks involved with it.\n\t\"Cryptocurrencies could be abused for money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing due to the speed and cross-border nature of the transactions,\" the spokesperson said.\n\t\"Digital payment token service providers in Singapore ... have to comply with requirements to mitigate such risks, including the need to carry out proper customer due diligence, conduct regular account reviews, and monitor and report suspicious transactions.\"\n\tFollowing Binance's withdrawal of bourse application from MAS recently to stop providing services in the city-state, the company's Singapore-only affiliate announced last week that it is shutting down its trading platform for the city-state by next Feb.\n\tAs per the scenario, following Binance's exit from the city-state, many other companies are likely to confront a similar fate in the near future.\n\tWhile Dubai-based crypto exchange Bitxmi is one of 103 companies that appear on the latest MAS list of entities whose exemptions allowing them to operate have been cancelled.\n\tAccording to Nikkei Asia, having set up Bitxmi in Singapore in late 2018, it was unsuccessful in securing a license, CEO Sanjay Jain said.\n\t\"We can't operate in Singapore,\" he said. \"We have an office there, but it's just more or less - there's one person for our accounting and legal issues.\"\n\tPrior to the introduction of the licensing regime, companies that were operating in Singapore were granted exemptions until the outcome of their license application is known. There were 90 crypto firms operating under such exemptions, Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told parliament in July.\n\tThe MAS website showed that the group had shrunk to about 70 as of Dec 14.\n\tUntil now - only DBS Vickers Securities, a unit of Singapore and Southeast Asia's largest bank, DBS Group Holdings; digital payments startup FOMO Pay; and Australia's Independent Reserve, which offers crypto exchange services - have been listed on the MAS website as licensed entities.\n\tThe reasons behind why specific crypto players were unable to obtain a permit have yet to be disclosed by the MAS.\n",

    "content": "\tPolygon Labs, the leading blockchain technology firm, issued a response today to a proposed rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that redefines the term \"exchange.\" The company argues that the proposed rule could pose a severe risk to the existence of permissionless blockchain networks and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols within the United States.\n\tThe SEC's reopening release suggests that not only DeFi software protocols enabling specific transactions on a permissionless, distributed ledger would have to register as a national securities exchange (NSE) or an alternative trading system (ATS), but also, the underlying ledgers or networks. Further, individuals or entities running or maintaining such systems would also need to register.\n\tPolygon Labs has pointed out that the new rule would be logistically unworkable, given the structure of blockchain technology. They highlight that the numerous independent validators of blockchain transactions cannot practically coordinate to register as an exchange, and these validators, by design, don't control DeFi protocols.\n\tThe blockchain technology firm also criticizes the SEC's proposal for its technological bias. It asserts that the rules are inconsistent, treating blockchain technology differently from other technological infrastructures such as cloud-based systems. The SEC's release proposes that any part of a blockchain-based system, including validators, must register, compared to only requiring the deployers of apps on cloud systems to do so. This approach, according to Polygon Labs, embodies a clear technological bias.\n\tIn its response, Polygon Labs maintains that implementing the proposed rule would effectively ban all permissionless blockchain networks in the U.S., as well as many software protocols built atop such networks, including DeFi protocols. The company's critique underscores the high stakes at hand, drawing attention to the potential impact of the SEC's proposed rule on the future of blockchain technology within the country.\n\tThe SEC has yet to respond to Polygon Labs' critique, but this latest exchange underscores the increasing tension between regulatory bodies and the blockchain industry, as each navigates the complexities of new technologies and their implications for financial systems.\n",

    "content": "\tA reportpublished by research projections from Binance released figures which amounted to ETH (Ether), averaging a correlation coefficient of 0.69. The research showed the following comparative values; “Ether is the highest correlated asset. With an average correlation coefficient of 0.69 throughout 2019, it is consistently among the most correlated assets. The coefficient started at 0.69 in Q1 and rose to 0.72 in Q4 (Q2: 0.65; Q3: 0.74).” Findings from the report show that Ether was relatively less correlated in the earlier half of 2019. The incline of its correlation began in the second half.\n\tWhat was most interesting is that research shows that ‘programmable blockchains,’ for instance, Ethereum, NEO, and EOS showed moderately higher correlations in comparison to non–programmable assets. The most significant contrast was amongst those assets with the lowest correlation, namely Cosmos, standing at a correlation of 0.31. To add are Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ) at coefficients of 0.32 and 0.4, respectively.\n\tThe “Binance Effect,” which was highlighted in the article, reveals that cryptos listed on Binance resembled higher correlations than those that are not listed. Additionally, the relationship between BTC and well- known commodities such as Gold is debatable, but recent data reveals that it is significantly less correlated than popular belief.\n",

    "content": "\tEthereum software developers finally released the validator launchpad for ETH 2.0, which enabled users to participate in the testnet’s Proof-of-Stake.\n\tLeveling up And Unlocking “Medalla”\n\tThe testnet, dubbed “Medalla,” is said to be released on August 4, if all goes well. Ethereum developers behind Medalla have also set up certain criteria that need to be fulfilled for the alternative blockchain to be unlocked.\n\tThe test run of the network will be in the hands of the community, and a minimum of 16,385 validators are required for the launch. Each of these users is required to deposit 32 Ether (ETH) coins to access the multi-client testnet. Also, “minimum genesis time” needs to be accomplished, which basically outlines when the earliest launch of ETH 2.0 testnet can be held.\n\tIf requirements are not fulfilled, Medalla’s launch will be delayed for 48 hours. The multi-client testnet will only launch if the two criteria are met.\n\tProgress On Unlocking Medalla\n\tSo far, it was reported that roughly more than 150,000 ETH tokens have been deposited, meaning that Medalla testnet has achieved 30.5% of the total number of validators it needs for a successful launch next week. Ethereum collaborated with blockchain tech company Consensys and DeepWork Studio to release the ETH 2.0 validator launchpad.\n\tEthereum Announces Its Testnet Strategy\n\tThe blockchain network told its Ethereum crypto community that the multi-client testnet Medalla, they will continue “fine-tuning the interface” in anticipation of the release of the mainnet. In addition to this, Ethereum also explained that as it was transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum 2.0 will be launched in at least 3 phases to make sure that all aspects are covered methodically before release.\n\tBy breaking up the phases, a different aspect of Ethereum 2.0 can be focused on at each phase and the mainnet can consequently be perfected.\n\tPhases of ETH 2.0\n\tPhases 0, 1, and 2 each outlines a different concept. Phases 0 focuses on all the machinery behind ETH 2.0’s consensus, and it tracks the validators and their transaction balances.\n\tPhase 1’s main objective is to handle the addition and storage of new and old data associated with ETH 2.0.\n\tFinally, Phase 2 adds execution to ETH 2.0, and this simply allows programs to be run on top of it.\n\tCo-Founder Vitalik Pushed for Phase 1\n\tCo-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin has been actively pushing for phase 1 to begin. The Ethereum mastermind wants to get a better grasp of how phase 1 will work in practice. On Reddit, he said that the \"clients team\" working on Medalla was behind on phase 0, and though that may be the case, they should still start working on phase 1. Buterin justified his strategy, saying:\n\t“There’s no unfinished research required for phase 1; it’s all spec optimization and development.”\n\tEthereum And Bitcoin “Bull Races”\n\tThis year has been a really good year for Ethereum. With their plans of launching ETH 2.0 mainnet, the blockchain platform has also managed to outrank Bitcoin earlier this month, sitting at approximately $2.5 billion and making it the first time since early 2019 that it has outdone its rival BTC.\n\tThe latter has however been picking up its pace on the crypto market after months of staying stagnant. Yesterday, it was reported that BTC surged past the $10, 000 mark. BTC as a hedge has also recently been even more of a hot topic, with the depreciation of USD due to economic stimulus packages released by the US government.\n\tReady, Set, Launch\n\tWith Medalla testnet set to launch on August 4, the year 2020 has been good for Ethereum. Medalla is to be the last testnet produced by the dominant cryptocurrency platform before ETH 2.0 mainnet is officially in service and open for public use.\n",

    "content": "\tAptos Labs, a blockchain startup, announced Monday that it raised $150 million in a Series A funding round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto.\n\tThe raise follows a seed round that Aptos conducted in March, bringing the company’s total funding to $350 million.\n\tOther investors, including Apollo, Griffin Gaming Partners, Franklin Templeton, Superscrypt, a16z crypto, and Multicoin, also participated in the Series A funding round.\n\tAptos disclosed that it plans to use the fresh funding to support further development of its programming language, Move, as well as its blockchain technology. Besides that, the firm said it would use the funds to expand its team further and continue developing ecosystem funds designed to attract developers and grow its community.\n\tAptos Labs, established by former employees who worked on Meta Platform Inc.’s collapsed payment system Diem, is building a Layer 1 blockchain that uses key technology from the ill-fated Diem project and its smart contract programming language Move. Such technologies were initially developed by the founding members of the Aptos team while at Facebook. Aptos is currently using these technologies as an open-source protocol to build a blockchain technology to rival blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, the second largest blockchain by market capitalisation.\n\tMo Shaikh, Aptos co-founder and CEO, talked about the development: “We’ve known for a while that, due to issues like outages and downtime, current blockchains are not fit for purpose when it comes to mass Web3 adoption. That’s why we’re building a blockchain to be the reliable foundation for Web3 that ushers in users from around the world to experience the benefits of decentralisation.”\n\tAptos aims to develop a reliable and safe smart contract programming language and blockchain network that will offer a superior experience for developers and users to keep their tokens secure.\n\tBased on such commitments, the firm is currently operating several testnets designed to reward developers for building its community ahead of a mainnet launch later this year. The firm recently announced a grant program planned to accelerate project growth in its platform.\n\tChris Dixon, founder and managing partner of a16z crypto, also commented: “Developers are flocking to Aptos for its speed and scalability, and as an entirely permissionless, open source, and community-governed blockchain, it’s also optimised for the creation of a new class of Web3-native applications.”\n\tIn April, Google Cloud became one of Aptos’s inaugural integration partners. The partnership is designed to enable developers to launch a node on the network within 15 minutes and start developing immediately.\n\tAptos has also partnered with several other firms (such as the NFT platform Rarible, video platform Livepeer, crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase) to test and build projects on the Layer 1 blockchain platform and smart contract programming language Move.\n\tMeta officially shut down its Diem stablecoin project in January following intense scrutiny from financial regulators. In February, Aptos Labs announced plans to bring the Diem blockchain back to life to develop the world's safest and most efficient blockchain.\n",

She highlighted that stablecoins could pose serious dangers, which could threaten monetary sovereignty and financial stability.\n\tCryptoassets are highly speculative and volatile\n\tLagarde threw criticism at crypto-assets for not being in a position to maintain a stable value because they are highly speculative, illiquid, and volatile. As a result, they do not adhere to the full functions of money.\n\tThe ECB president said in a statement on Nov 30, that stablecoins have the potential of driving additional innovation in payments and be integrated into trade, social media, and other platforms. Lagarde cautioned:\n\t“If widely adopted, they could threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty. For instance, if the issuer cannot guarantee a fixed value or if they are perceived as being incapable of absorbing losses, a run could occur.”\n\tBy using stablecoins as a store of value, Lagarde believes this could trigger a paradigm shift of bank deposits to these digital assets. This could distort the transmission of monetary policy and banks' operations.\n\tThe rollout of a Digital Euro\n\tLagarde also delved into the issue of the digital euro, viewing it as a game-changer in the modern era. She noted:\n\t“A digital euro would complement cash and ensure that consumers continue to have unrestricted access to central bank money in a form that meets their evolving digital payment needs.”\n\tThe ECB president acknowledged that the issuance of a digital euro could be pivotal in ensuring the continued access to monetary sovereignty and central bank money.\n\tHer praises for the digital euro comes at a time when the German Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, recently called for speedy interventions in the rollout of this digital currency because it can be an ideal instrument to fill the void triggered by a high demand for digital money from businesses and consumers in Europe.\n",

Blockchain.News, citing Reuters reported that Japan had requested crypto exchanges to suspend transactions of crypto assets that are subject to asset-freeze sanctions against Russia and Belarus, following concerns from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, Reuters reported citing national officials.\n\tConcerns among the G7 economies have been growing as they believe that the Russian government is using cryptocurrencies to tackle financial sanctions imposed upon the country for invading Ukraine, the report added.\n\tThe US Treasury Department has also issued new guidance that has asked US-based cryptocurrency firms to stop transactions with sanction targets.\n\tMeanwhile, four payment service operators such as American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, have also announced the suspension of their operations in Russia in protest of the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n",

    "time": "2021-09-09",
    "author": "Mervyn Kwan",
    "content": "\tThe Ukrainian Parliament has passed a bill draft in the second reading Wednesday concerning legalising and regulating cryptocurrency and other virtual assets, such as tokens.\n\tApproved by 276 lawmakers, the bill will take effect and become law after signing by President Volodymyr Zelensky, enabling the protection of virtual assets from fraud.\n\tAccording to the official data, the daily turnover of virtual assets across the country accounts for $37000. The administration believes the legislation would make crypto safer and more legal to attract more investors to participate.\n\t“Only a few countries in the world have legalised crypto assets — Germany, Luxembourg, Singapore. Ukraine will be one of them,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, said.\n\tIn Ukraine, virtual assets in Ukraine are not under the protection of local law. Residents are not allowed to use crypto as a way of payment or exchange goods or services, except the Hryvnia- the legal tender in Ukraine. According to the report, Ukrainians can only trade or conduct exchange crypto through local or Ukraine-registered foreign exchange platforms.\n\tExperts argue that is a crucial milestone to Ukraine, as the bill has interpreted the definition of virtual assets “as intangible assets in the form of digital data”, also define the terminology, such as “wallet” for virtual currency or private key; but also allow the country to regulate the crypto market in the future.\n\tTo prevent money-laundering illegal activities, crypto businesses, which intend to register, need to declare their activities to the authority.\n\tLocal media, citing an official source, said the Kyiv government plans to open the crypto market for investors and the business sector next year when the tax code and the civil code is amended and ready.\n\tDespite the current regulators, the administration prefers to introduce more watchdogs to issue permits for crypto businesses.\n\tUkraine intends to escalate the use of crypto across the whole country. Last month, the administration announced plans to pay salaries to workers by central bank digital currency.\n",

    "time": "2024-03-23",
    "author": "Luisa Crawford",
    "content": "\tWorldcoin (WLD), a blockchain-based identity platform known for its novel approach to user verification through iris scanning, has taken a significant step towards enhancing user privacy with the implementation of Personal Custody. This development comes as part of the project’s ongoing efforts to provide a user-centric and secure identification system.\n\tPersonal Custody is a feature that allows individuals to retain all personal data, including images, metadata, and derived data generated at the orb during World ID verification, directly on their devices. By doing so, users gain unprecedented control over their information, with the ability to manage its flow and usage before opting for deletion. This shift from the prior default deletion of data to personal custody is a response to privacy concerns and recommendations from experts in the field.\n\tThe implementation of Personal Custody requires a sophisticated multi-step process. It begins with the user's device generating a public-private key pair to encrypt the data, followed by the backend creating additional keys for double encryption. The orb captures the necessary images for verification, creates individual data packages, and encrypts them before transmitting them to the backend. After the encrypted data packages are downloaded to the user's device, they are deleted from the backend to ensure no residual data remains.\n\tThis approach not only places users in control but also introduces the possibility of using Face Authentication for high-security applications. Face Authentication allows users to confirm their identity locally on their device without transferring any data externally, thus promising a higher level of security and privacy.\n\tThe adoption of Personal Custody is emblematic of the platform's user-centric architecture, a core aspect of the Worldcoin Tech Tree. This architecture is designed to facilitate the separation and replacement of system components like orbs and uniqueness metrics, making it easier to evolve the protocol into an open, permissionless system governed by a broad user base.\n\tWhile the initiative marks a substantial move towards personal data sovereignty, it also implies that optional Data Custody will no longer be offered during orb visits. This change encourages users to educate themselves about Worldcoin and make informed choices regarding the sharing of their information to support the project's improvement.\n\tFor those interested in delving deeper into the technicalities of Worldcoin's privacy measures and system architecture, the Technical Implementation section of the Worldcoin protocol whitepaper provides detailed insights. The Worldcoin community is also actively engaged in discussions across various social platforms, such as Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord, YouTube, and LinkedIn, and interested individuals can stay updated by subscribing to the blog newsletter.\n\tIt is important to note that the availability of Worldcoin (WLD) tokens is subject to geographic, age, and other restrictions. While WLD tokens are not accessible in the United States and some other territories, the World ID and TFH’s World App remain available. Prospective users are advised to consult the Terms of Use and the Important User Information found on the Worldcoin website for further details on eligibility and risks.\n",

    "time": "2021-08-26",
    "author": "News Publisher",
    "content": "\tWill Litecoin Double Again by the End of 2021?\n\tLitecoin was developed and released in 2011 by Charlie Lee and has been one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap for the major part of the last decade. However, Litecoin’s market cap has recently witnessed a downturn and it currently ranks at number 16, at the time of writing.\n\tLitecoin, which serves as an alternative to Bitcoin, has certain significant differences that make it a more attractive choice. It has a faster block generation time which means that transactions through Litecoin can happen much faster when compared to Bitcoin. Further, Litecoin has a different hashing mechanism. Hence, mining Litecoin is a far simpler process when compared to the complicated and advanced Bitcoin mining process.\n\tOver the course of Litecoin’s price history, it has largely followed the trend marked by the price movement of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Until 2017, the price of Litecoin was largely dormant similar to other cryptocurrencies. However, it took off in 2017 thanks to the unprecedented bullishness of the cryptocurrency market, witnessing a rally of around 4000% in seven months that year.\n\tIn 2020, Litecoin more than tripled its market cap and touched a record-high of $388 in May but has seen a significant drop since then.\n\tNow, the question is whether Litecoin will return to these highs before the end of the year, or not. To draw our conclusions, we’ve relied on expert reports, fundamental analysis, as well as technicals. Investors should also note that predicting the price of Litecoin is much more difficult compared to other investment classes such as equities and bonds.\n\tFinder’s Panel Report\n\tFinder conducted a survey of 42 fintech specialists about the future prospects of Litecoin. This survey found that most experts believe that Litecoin will touch a price point of $266 by the end of the year. This would mark gains of around 50% from current levels ($177).\n\tThese findings were similar to other panels’ opinions on cryptocurrencies such as DogeCoin and Ethereum. DOGE is expected to hit $1.21 by 2025 while ETH is expected to touch $4,500 by December 2021.\n\tHowever, even though Litecoin is expected to witness price gains over the course of the year, the panellists believe that the digital asset is going to continue losing relevance to other cryptocurrencies. Most of them believe that Litecoin is never going to be back in the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.\n\tSeveral of these panellists believe that Litecoin has been irreparably hurt by Charlie Lee’s sale of his stake. A vote of no-confidence by the cryptocurrency’s own founder may have hurt the chances of Litecoin of being a serious contender in the cryptocurrency game.\n\tSolid Fundamentals\n\tLitecoin’s future looks positive when measured in terms of its fundamentals. Litecoin, as has been mentioned earlier, enjoys significant advantages over Bitcoin in terms of the blockchain technology backing it. Litecoin also charges lower fees when compared to Bitcoin making the former a good alternative to the flagship cryptocurrency in the future.\n\tFurther, Litecoin is witnessing increasing market acceptance and was recently added to Bitpay’s payments service. This means that users of Bitpay can now transact using Litecoin through the platform. With an increase in the number of partners and widespread adoption, the value of Litecoin should gain pace as we inch closer towards the end of 2021.\n\tRather than just being used for speculative purposes, Litecoin has the potential to become a real digital currency accepted by merchants around the world. If this happens, then the future value of Litecoin could easily grow exponentially from current levels.\n\tLastly, Litecoin has been noted to be less volatile when compared to other cryptocurrencies. This makes it an attractive investment choice for investors who are more risk-averse.\n\tTricky Technicals\n\tTechnical factors too need to be considered when judging Litecoin’s future near-term price movements. Analysis has found that Litecoin faces a major resistance level around the $200 mark. Moreover, the resistance is further exacerbated since $200 is also a major psychological block.\n\tIn case Litecoin manages to cross the $200 mark, it may see a period of high growth by the end of the year.\n\tFurther, social metrics do not seem to look too positive for Litecoin. Social volumes and weighted sentiment are lagging significantly behind May levels. Litecoin’s active addresses (24-hours) have also witnessed a strong drop.\n\tOverall, this shows that in terms of technicals, the outlook does not seem positive enough for Litecoin to double by the end of the year.\n\tWrap Up\n\tLitecoin’s price has picked up again over the past month. If the broader cryptocurrency market remains bullish, Litecoin could see some significant gains by the end of the year. However, it is highly unlikely that Litecoin’s price will double in this time frame. Investors looking towards Litecoin may find that it serves as a better long-term investment rather than for short-term trading purposes.\n",

This upward trend will make Dubai account for about 1% of the global blockchain value.\n\tSmart Dubai executives noted at the Dubai Blockchain Strategy 2020 that out of 8,000 worldwide blockchain companies, 114 or 1.4% of them are based in Dubai.\n\tDubai’s strategies of being a blockchain hub\n\tOne of Smart Dubai’s primary objectives is to make Dubai the happiest city globally. This goal is to be achieved by leveraging on technological advancements, such as blockchain.\n\tIn October 2016, the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced that Dubai would be powered via blockchain. By 2021, it is expected to be the first city to be fully powered by blockchain.\n\tSmart Dubai noted, “Adopting Blockchain technology Dubai stands to unlock 5.5 billion dirhams, approximately $1.5 billion in savings annually in document processing alone — equal to the one Burj Khalifa’s worth of value every year.”\n\tNearly 24 blockchain use cases are being implemented across eight sectors. This initiative is touted to be instrumental in propelling Dubai’s smart city transformation efforts in 2020.\n\tDr. Aisha Bint Butti Bin Bishr, director-general of the Smart Dubai Department, affirmed, “We accomplished what we promised of building a holistic blockchain ecosystem in Dubai. We have been working with government and private sector partners to identify a series of use cases across multiple sectors. Blockchain cannot solve everything, and we need to be wise in selecting these use cases. That is what we have done here.”\n\tThe shared Dubai blockchain platform was established in collaboration with IBM to permit government entities to build use cases without necessarily investing in individual infrastructure.\n",

    "time": "2019-12-09",
    "author": "News Publisher",
    "content": "\tNew Money Theory Research: Blockchain to Usher in the New Age of Monetary and Financial Freedom\n\tThroughout history, humans have progressed through both a reliance on institutions and in many cases by rebelling against institutions that no longer serve them. In order to improve the overall social efficiency of our civilization, processes of social division of labor emerged where individuals would transfer their rights to an institution like the government or a bank which acts as credit agency. Governments and banks are indeed the most typical credit agencies in existence. It may not be that obvious, but credit agencies are actually everywhere and act as intermediaries for most basic transactions in human life. There are few deals that people can make without a third party involved.\n\tWhen people initiate a property purchase transaction, they do not simply exchange money with the current owner for the deed of that property. They are obligated through traditional systems to put trust into third parties or intermediaries such as mortgage lenders, real estate agents, brokers/realtors, home inspectors, home appraisers, insurance agents etc. In our current economic ecosystem, the owner and buyer will find it almost impossible to make a property deal without the involvement of a third party.\n\tHere is another example. Let’s say you have 10 million U.S. dollars. Unless you have the amount in physical cash, you do not actually hold the money; instead, what you do have is access to a bank account that records your ownership of the sum. Without a second thought, you put all your trust into the bank that creates and maintains that record of your finances. The reality is that the reliability, security and accounting of banking institutions is a system that people simply take for granted in this modern era—but is it the best way? Well, let’s go deeper, what may surprise some is that the actual value of our money itself is also completely reliant on the trust people have for their Central Bank—the embodiment of their nation’s credit. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, a monetary standard that created money backed by gold reserves—our fiat currencies are now issued based on national credit and by the central banks. Central banking practices, however, have a demonstrable history of devaluing our currencies. It only takes a conscientious look back at the history of currency issuance through national credit to deduce that this contemporary system is extremely unreliable. While most people today still appear to view the U.S. as the most financially reliable country in the world, the reality is that we have seen the U.S. national credit default on several occasions. The collapse of Bretton Woods system was, in fact, the result of a U.S. national default. As Bitcoin founder Satoshi once said: “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”\n\tIf we could reduce our reliance on credit agencies to a bare minimum, we can cut out significant transaction costs and more importantly—lower the risks of institutional power being abused or expanded. Credit agencies by their nature abuse and expand their power, usually under the guise of serving the people, which in extreme cases could lead to dictatorship and monopoly. Wherever there is a dependence, there is the possibility of being enslaved. Human history is largely a history of fighting against imposed “serfdom”.\n\tOne of the greatest achievements in the history of humanity, was the introduction of constitutions for the purpose of restricting government’s power and protecting private ownership—basic laws that apply to all people and served to abolish class systems. However, there is still one more hidden, untamed and indirect powers exist that are driving us to economic serfdom—the U.S. dollar and the Federal Reserve that creates its monetary policies.\n\tOil Exclusively Adopting U.S. Dollar Replaces Gold standard\n\tThe Vietnam war proved costly for the U.S., requiring the nation to spend vast resources to fund its military operations. During this period, the excessive printing of U.S. dollars to pay for the expense pushed up the dollar’s commodity price but could not affect the stable price level of its pegged gold benchmark. The continuous inflation of U.S. dollars resulted in an accelerated pileup of at least USD 80 billion Eurodollars which European wanted to redeem their USD for gold in late 1960s.\n\tThe collapse of Bretton Woods was a result of gradual loss of confidence in U.S. dollar. In May 1971, West Germany left the Bretton Wood system and Switzerland redeemed USD 50 million for gold. In early August 1971, France sent a warship to New York Harbor and redeemed USD 191 million from the New York Federal Reserve Bank. On August 11, the British ambassador requested to redeem USD 3 billion for gold[1]. These gold withdrawals have placed mounting pressure on U.S.’s long term gold reserves. In an attempt to protect the remaining U.S. gold reserves, President Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard. By dissolving the Bretton Woods agreement, Nixon and his globalist accomplice, Henry Kissinger, knew global demand for the dollar would decline. Since then, the U.S. gold reserve kept unchanged.\n\tAfter the Yom Kippur war, the Saudis and Americans struck a deal—the U.S. would protect the Saudi oilfields and restrain any threats from Israel and in return the Saudis agreed to price all of their oil sales in U.S. dollars only and to refuse all other currencies. This led to the rise of Petrodollar [2].\n\tBy 1975, every single oil-producing nation of the OPEC had agreed to price their oil in dollars and to hold their surplus oil proceeds in U.S. government debt securities in exchange for the generous offers made by the U.S. The world’s subsequent reliance on oil further galvanized the U.S. dollar as the de facto world currency to facilitate trade and commerce meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to monopolize U.S. monetary policies without restriction.\n\tAs Lord Acton famously expressed to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887—absolute power corrupts absolutely—and the U.S. dollar has unfortunately not been the exception to this rule. Unlike the gold standard, currency created without consensus and without support, will fall prey to the law of the jungle which holds that the habitat is destined to be ruled by the apex species. While the U.S. dollar is clearly no longer at the apex, the currency has been manipulated through monetary policies in order to maintain its current dominant international status. These policies have unfortunately been created to serve the sole interests of the currency issuer, even when it undermines the economic wellbeing of other countries or regions and their people—indirectly leading the world into the soft dictatorship of the U.S. dollar.\n\tIf the U.S. dollar represents our monetary enslavement then blockchain-based cryptocurrency paves the way to monetary freedom in some sense.\n\tThe Essential Advantage of Blockchain\n\tBlockchains incorporate several important features such as immutability, encryption and distributed storage, which combined makes secure peer-to-peer transactions possible and in turn has created the means to end human dependence on credit and thus credit intermediaries. Due to these features, blockchain has been referred to as ‘the Trust Machine’ and is forecasted to transfer the trust from agencies and institutions which are enforced by law to machine-based networks guaranteed by technology and mathematics.\n\tLet’s take a look at the profound potential impact blockchain has on our monetary and financial system. We previously introduced three key aspects of money: money forms, money issuance standards, and the flow of money.[3] With blockchain, we are leveraging a brand-new system of architecture for the flow of money. In addition, blockchain makes new forms of money available that could bring us to realize the notion of “absolutely private property” for the first time in human history—where ownership of an asset on a blockchain is guaranteed by technology and mathematics. Bitcoin, for example, the original cryptocurrency, of which the ownership depends on a private encrypted key. Without the correct private key, there is no way to move bitcoins around, even if it is ordered by law on pain of enforcement. As for the money issuance standard, blockchain has even more to offer.\n\tBlockchain-based Money Issuance Standard for a Better Society\n\tBitcoin opens the door to new concepts of money issuance. The issuance of bitcoin is by Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm first proposed in 1993. By the algorithm, the problem of issuance of bitcoin is reduced to the task of mining.\n\tBitcoin mining is “the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together.” [4] The computation power of the bitcoin network is generally measured by the hash rate. Bitcoin mining has raised concerns around power and computing power waste. However, computing power may be the most important basic parameter and issue of our future society. It would motivate the improvement of computing power and research of high-efficiency power usage. The more important question here is how to reduce the consumption of power and convert computing power to computer contributions in some sense.\n\tWe propose our principle for the money issuance standard: extract the most important parameter(s) from the driving forces behind human society and future technological developments; then use these factor(s) as inputs of the money issuance rule. In this way, the problem of money issuance is reduced to contributions to factor(s) that make the world better.\n\tThe Profound Impact of the New Money Issuance Standard\n\tThe era of “machine-orientation” is the beginning of measuring the value of people and machines with a unified scale, and it is also the beginning of the blurring of the boundaries between people and machines in terms of social contribution. Different from the traditional human labor based social value system, the new standard will lead us to rethink and reconstruct our entire social value system. The emergence of bitcoin and blockchain thus marked the beginning of the transition from a carbon-based civilization to a silicon-based civilization. Although we can map real world assets to blockchain, we still need a currency to measure the value of the blockchain system itself.\n\tCurrency—the Key Factor in Future Blockchain-based Value Networks\n\tFor future value networks that are blockchain based, we need to answer some basic questions regarding value: What is value? How is value created and where makes something valuable? Currency is the most direct means of value quantification and is the most basic form for the evaluation value of a blockchain network. The money issuance standard on blockchain will determine how to create money, in turn it will determine its value, which consequently will re-define all social values.\n\tAbout the Authors:\n\tKun Hu\n\tCEO of Worldmoney.org\n\tProfessor Francis Lau\n\tAssociate dean of Faculty of Engineering, HKU; Former Department Head of Computer Sciences; Former vice president of the IEEE Computer Society.\n\tContributors\n\tMatthew Lam\n\tContent Manager of Blockchain.News\n\tLucas Cacioli\n\tJournalist of Blockchain.News\n\t[1] IOWA State University, Department of Economics, Bretton Woods System\n\t[2] FXCM.com, What is the Petrodollar?\n\t[3] Fighting for Monetary and Financial Freedom - Blockchain in Human History Series\n\t[4] Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\n",

    "content": "\tThe digital asset management (DAM) market is expected to generate revenue worth $9.32 billion by 2028 based on soaring demand, according to a report by SkyQuest Technology Consulting.\n\tWith a market value of $3.68 billion set in 2021, this sector is speculated to record a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.2% during the 2022-2028 forecast period.\n\tSince the global society is becoming digital-centric, some key trends expected to drive this market include financial institutions’ heightened adoption of blockchain technology for transparency and traceability purposes.\n\tFurthermore, the diversification of crypto investment products is anticipated to propel the DAM market. Per the report:\n\t“Several providers are expanding their cryptocurrency investment offerings beyond simply providing exposure to digital assets via derivatives or tokens. These platforms are also offering managed accounts and other services that make it easier for investors to get started.”\n\tSince DAM enables organizations to manage, store, and track digital assets like documents, videos, and images, the usage of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is rising.\n\tSkyQuest pointed out:\n\t“Several players in the global digital asset management market are increasingly incorporating DAOs into their offerings, as this type of arrangement provides users with more control over their assets and helps reduce costs associated with traditional approaches such as custodial solutions.”\n\tBusinesses also leverage the digital asset management market to protect their intellectual property and optimize their information strategies and communication. As a result, index funds and hedge funds are eyeing this sector.\n\tPer the report:\n\t“Many hedge fund firms are starting to explore the potential of investing in digital assets, as this sector has shown strong growth in recent years.”\n\tSkyQuest intended to comprehend trends in operations and consumer behaviour in the digital asset management market through the study.\n\tMeanwhile, the blockchain in the manufacturing market is expected to render revenue worth $766.2 million in 2030, according to a recent report by Verified Market Research.\n",

    "content": "\tTech conglomerate Cisco and decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) firm SingularityNET have reached a partnership to develop a decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) project. The ambitious project aims to create more advanced AI technologies that will soon be able to exceed human abilities to learn and perform new tasks.\n\tAGI is an emerging new field of AI that mainly focuses on a computer’s ability to learn intellectual tasks such as learning how to write a book, tasks that humans are capable of. SingularityNET’s technologies include a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace for AI algorithms and other deep neural net models for computer vision and language understanding.\n\tDr. Ben Goertzel, SingularityNET CEO, believes that AGI will advance far beyond the current state, and in the next decade, AGIs will have higher IQs than humans.\n\t“We’re going to see AGI elements coming into play this year,” he said. “Within the next couple of years, you’ll start to see tremendously intelligent agents that start to really solve some of the problems that we’re having,” said Goertzel.\n\tThe partnership with Cisco originated from the need for an AI system that can generalize and learn across different areas. Goertzel stated:\n\t“The scale of the AGI deployments needed by a partner like Cisco is going to be tremendous, and we are working hard to make sure our AGI tools and our blockchain-based platform is up to the task. The work we’ve done with Cisco on smart traffic analytics using OpenCog’s logical reasoning and deep neural networks just scratches the surface. Let’s just say we have some much broader and deeper conversations going on.”\n",

    "time": "2020-07-09",
    "author": "Shine Li",
    "content": "\tScammers have been taking advantage of the confusion caused by COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent worldwide economic crisis in order to retrieve sensitive information and phish personal data from Microsoft users.\n\tIt was reported by Corporate Vice President of Microsoft, Tom Burt, that Microsoft users from at least 62 countries around the world have been defrauded by cyber criminals phishing for sensitive data. The online hackers operated by sending COVID-19 labeled files to a victim’s email account, which were purposely marketed in a way that incited users to click on the malware. Following that, malicious web applications were then able to access the victims’ Microsoft Office 365 account.\n\tThis is known as a form of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack. It has become increasingly sophisticated and complex to prevent, as new software is constantly developing, and scammers have upgraded to more creative phishing schemes.\n\tLuckily, following a court order issued by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Microsoft has finally been able to seize control of the key domains in the cyber criminals’ infrastructure, in an effort of putting an end to cyberattacks targeting their multinational tech company.\n\tFBI Internet Crime Reports\n\tWith cybercrime on the rise, the FBI’s 2019 Internet Crime Report indicated that BEC attacks figured among the most costly complaints, resulting in over $1.7 billion of financial damages. FBI also reported that from 2016-2019, businesses lost approximately $26 billion dollars due to fraudulent emails.\n\tAccording to Safepost, the use of decentralized technology in emails have yet to be fully utilized and a blockchain-based solution would solve the majority of problems that traditional email providers faced. A decentralized email solution would entail that messages would be stored in shared ledgers. In other words, no single authority would be able to dictate how your data was used.\n\tMonero Used in Cybercrime\n\tWith phishing attacks being increasingly common in the crypto world, virtual currencies, such as Zcash and Monero (XMR), are more and more favoured by scammers because of their privacy features. XMR stands at the top of the list for the most private cryptocurrencies on the market. Because it operates on blockchain technology and its network is obfuscated, Monero is a popular choice employed by cybercriminals in carrying out illicit cyber scams.\n",

Moreover, students rely on online and hybrid options to enhance their career and learning journeys.\n\tMeanwhile, Chengdu, the capital city of China’s Sichuan province, revealed plans to use blockchain applications for smart education.\n",

    "time": "2022-11-07",
    "author": "Blockchain.News Marketing",
    "content": "\tGeneva, Switzerland, 7th November, 2022, Chainwire\n\tMessari, the leading provider of crypto market intelligence, released two quarterly analysis reports related to the TRON ecosystem – State of TRON Q3 2022 and State of USDD Q3 2022. The two most significant highlights in the comparison of Q3 with Q2 2022 were the 480.4% increase in the number of holders of USDD and the 71% increase in the Total Value Locked of TRX. Both reports indicated positive conclusions about the stability and secure strength of USDD and the TRON network as a whole.\n\tState of USDD\n\tThe USDD report marked the first time Messari provided market intelligence in a quarterly report on the over-collateralized stablecoin issued by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). USDD is backed by select crypto assets, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The State of USDD report includes insights on performance, issuance, deposits, reserve balance, user adoption, transactions, price analysis, and total value locked. Readers can also get qualitative analysis on subjects such as monetary policy and the peg stability module (PSM).\n\tKey insights on the USDD Report include:\n\tIt is worth noting that since USDD was launched in May 2022, the supply has grown to over 725 million with almost all of its growth occurring in the first two months. The Messari Report pointed out that there is currently over 36 billion USDT circulating on the TRON blockchain, which they commented “leaves a lot of room for growth for USDD.” The Binance and Ethereum blockchains now also carry USDD. TRON Founder H.E. Justin Sun envisioned USDD offering the opportunity to access currency pegged to the US dollar for anyone and anywhere. Based on the first five months of its existence, that aspiration appears to have a solid start toward becoming reality.\n\tGiven that the TRON DAO Reserve has to deposit and stake an equivalent amount of TRX as collateral in order to mint new USDD, the Messari Report also noted that “TRX holders are likely the greatest beneficiaries of USDD adoption, given the potential reduction in circulating supply should adoption grow.” A growing number of partnerships, like TRON becoming the National Blockchain of Dominica and the Huobi Global Advisory Board promising to leverage USDD in pairs with all crypto on their exchange, will likely result in greater user adoption of USDD over the coming years.\n\tState of TRON\n\tThe State of TRON Report was also the first edition of quarterly coverage from Messari. This report highlights performance analysis, ecosystem development, and a qualitative analysis. Readers can also get an overview on TRON’s TVL, Strategy and Challenges, and a forecast of the road ahead.\n\tKey insights on the TRON Report include:\n\tThe Messari Report offered this complimentary insight in their Ecosystem and Development Overview of TRON:\n\tBoth reports noted the stabilizing effect of USDD’s collateralization, adoption, and future use cases, as well as the remarkable strength of TRON TVL. The TRON DAO community is thrilled with the encouraging conclusions from the Messari research team.\n\tAbout TRON DAO\n\tTRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.\n\tFounded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 118 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.1 billion total transactions, and over $11.8 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\tTRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum\n",

    "content": "\tNon-fungible token (NFT) platform, Omni was hacked for 1,300 ether (ETH) ($1.43 million) as the hacker exploited the firm's reentrancy vulnerability protocol, according to PeckShield.\n\tThe NFT money market platform allows users to stake their NFTs on the platform, normally open staking for popular collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, to receive tokens like ETH.\n\tAlthough the hacker was able to drain out more than 1,300 wETH ($1.4 million), the ERC20 tradable version of ETH, Omni stated that the theft did not affect customers' funds. The company added that only internal testing funds were impacted as the platform is still in beta testing mode.\n\tThe protocol has been suspended for a complete investigation, according to the NFT company.\n\tAccording to The Block, projects coded with Solidity are vulnerable to reentrancy. It allows hackers to force their smart contract to make an external call to an untrusted contract.\n\tFor this nature of the hack, Yajin Zhou - CEO of blockchain security company BlockSec - told The Block that the hacker deposited NFTs from a collection called Doodles, which were used to borrow wrapped ETH (WETH), tokenized versions of cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of the original coin.\n\tFollowing the deposit and liquidation of the position, the remaining Doodle NFT from the original collateral is returned back to the attacker.\n\tZhou added that hackers often liquidate the loan position as the value of the NFT left as collateral before the callback function was invoked isn't sufficient to cover the debt position. To tackle this, hackers typically rely on reentrancy as they are able to force through using borrowed WETH to buy more NFTs before the liquidation occurs.\n\tFurthermore, Zhou added that the hacker then used the Doodles NFT acquired with the initial loan as collateral to borrow more WETH. However, as Omni had failed to recognize this new position, the hacker could withdraw the NFTs without paying back the loan.\n\tAccording to The Block, data from Etherscan shows the attacker has already laundered the funds via a coin mixing service for private transactions on Ethereum called Tornado Cash.\n",

    "content": "\tThrough its investment firm SGInnovate, the Singaporean administration has teamed up with local startup Accredify to establish a blockchain-powered digital health passport to boost medical records management. This development will enable healthcare data to be kept in a digital wallet.\n\tBlockchain app tested with COVID-19 data\n\tThe blockchain-enabled application was piloted in May using COVID-19 data during the height of the global pandemic. At the time, COVID-19 discharge memos were authenticated more than 1.5 million times.\n\tThe digital health passport is touted to be instrumental in streamlining healthcare providers’ workflow as personal medical documents will be stored on a blockchain network. As a result, medical records like COVD-19 discharge memos and swab results will be digitized. As per the announcement:\n\t“This feature bypasses the need for paper-based documents, which are difficult to manage and easily replicated, lost, or misplaced, the organizations said in a joint statement Wednesday.”\n\tThrough the Ministry of Finance funding, SGInnovate keeps a keen eye on investments in deep tech startups under emerging technologies like medical technology, blockchain, and artificial intelligence.\n\tProtecting personal health data\n\tThe blockchain application will only ensure the revelation of personal health data to relevant authorities. As a result, this will optimize privacy, security, and transparency. SGInnovate said:\n\t“Digital Health Passport leverages blockchain technology to generate tamper-proof cryptographic protections for each medical document. Users can automatically verify the digital records via a mobile app and present it to officials via QR code, for a quick and seamless verification process.”\n\tThe digital health passport might be extended to the travel sector in the future and render benefits like propelling verifications and checks on travelers’ health status at border and boarding check-points for maximized safety.\n\tIt looks like the sky’s the limit when it comes to blockchain application in the health sector. For instance, the administration of Telangana, a southern Indian state, recently disclosed its intentions to avert any attempt of hoarding or black-marketing of COVID-19 vaccines using blockchain technology.\n",

    "time": "2024-01-10",
    "author": "Luisa Crawford",
    "content": "\tBinance, the globally recognized cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced an innovative promotional campaign to elevate the profile of its USDC-margined perpetual contracts. This move is part of Binance's broader strategy to diversify its offerings and stimulate user engagement in the ever-evolving crypto futures market.\n\tUnderstanding the Promotion\n\tThe promotion, which targets both regular and VIP 1-3 users, offers a dual incentive structure. The first part, \"Promotion A\", focuses on deposits. Users who deposit a minimum of 100 USDC into their Futures Wallet and maintain this for a specified period are eligible for trading fee rebate vouchers. The reward structure is tiered based on the deposit amount and the duration for which it's maintained. For instance, users depositing at least 100 USDC for a minimum of 5 days can earn a 5 USDC trading fee rebate voucher, with higher rewards for larger deposits and longer durations.\n\tThe second part, \"Promotion B\", incentivizes trading activity. Participants who trade a minimum of 1,000 USDC in USDC-Margined Perpetual Contracts are eligible for a share of a dynamic rewards pool, potentially totaling up to 45,000 USDC in token vouchers. The size of this pool varies depending on the number of participants, with a maximum of 6,000 participants eligible for the highest reward tier.\n\tBinance's Strategic Expansion\n\tThis promotional campaign is a part of Binance's strategic expansion in the derivatives market. By introducing USDC-margined perpetual contracts, Binance aims to offer traders more flexibility and diversity in their trading options. These contracts, which are available for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and XRP, allow users to trade with leverage, amplifying both potential gains and risks.\n\tBinance's focus on USDC-margined contracts also aligns with broader market trends. As stablecoins continue to gain prominence in the crypto ecosystem, Binance's initiative to integrate USDC into its futures trading offerings signifies its commitment to staying at the forefront of market developments. Moreover, the exchange is leveraging these contracts to phase out support for BUSD, highlighting a strategic shift in its stablecoin preferences.\n\tImplications and Context\n\tThis promotional campaign comes at a crucial time for the crypto market. As anticipation builds around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, market sentiment is showing signs of positivity. These developments, coupled with Binance's promotional efforts, could catalyze increased activity in the crypto futures market, attracting both seasoned traders and new entrants.\n\tHowever, it's important to note that while such promotions can stimulate market activity, they also underscore the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. Participants in these markets should be aware of the volatility and the potential for significant losses alongside gains.\n\tConclusion\n\tBinance's promotional campaign for USDC-margined perpetual contracts represents a strategic effort to bolster its position in the competitive crypto derivatives market. By offering incentives for both depositing and trading, Binance is not only encouraging user participation but also highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins like USDC in the broader crypto ecosystem.\n",

By doing so, the government aims to use them reliably and safely.\n\t\"We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term,\" Sunak said.\n\tThe UK also plans to actively explore the benefits of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in UK financial markets, John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said. The DLT allows synchronicity and sharing of data in a decentralized manner to achieve greater efficiency, transparency and resilience.\n\tThe website also added that \"the government will legislate to establish a financial market infrastructure (FMI) 'Sandbox' that will enable firms to experiment and innovate in providing the infrastructure services that underpin markets, in particular by enabling Distributed Ledger Technology to be tested.\"\n\tThe government has also planned to initiate a research programme to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of using DLT for sovereign debt instruments.\n\tFor further development of the crypto-asset market in the UK, the government has plans to review how DeFi loans – where holders of cryptoa-ssets lend them out for a return – are treated for tax purposes, and also to consult on extending the scope of the Investment Manager Exemption to include crypto-assets.\n\tUK Plans to Mint its NFT\n\tOther announcements include the creation of a non-fungible token (NFT) in the summer under commission from Sunak; and a Cryptoasset Engagement Group, established and chaired by the Economic Secretary - who will convene \"key figures from the regulatory authorities and industry to advise the government on issues facing the crypto-asset sector\".\n\tFurther details have yet to be released by the government.\n",

    "content": "\tThe crypto market holds at least 4,000 tokens to-date. As a result, the demand for a trusted financial index by traders has been elevated to unprecedented heights.\n\tThe Crypto Price Index (CPI) is anticipated to be an ideal crypto market indicator because it will include over 200 of the top traded cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization. Expressly, it is expected to function like the Dow Jones Industrial Average by offering insights about the trading history of the major blockchain projects.\n\tA proprietary chain blockchain engineers the CPI, and it is one of the few indexes that shows the overall state of the cryptocurrency market and further enhances public access to the network.\n\tThe CEO of CPI, Herbert Law, acknowledged: “Given my background in traditional finance and commodities trading, I understand the value of market indicators for making sound investment decisions. We aim to provide a reference point for crypto traders, which we believe will lower barriers to entry by saving investors time and resources normally spent on research with our crypto index that provides a single, easy-to-understand number representing overall market health.”\n\tConversely, an advisor to CPI’s board noted: “I applaud the CPI project for approaching the digital asset markets with stability and transparency in mind. Solutions like CPI, which build with non-technical users in mind, will ensure decentralized finance grows and reaches mass adoption.”\n\tFor industry validation and international recognition, CPI has collaborated with members of the Emirati Royal Family.\n",

    "content": "\tEl Salvador is a unique example of Bitcoin adoption and a very fertile ground for Bitcoin to thrive on. The country lost its national currency in the early 2000s, and the current national currency there is the US dollar. El Salvador’s economy is weak, and much of the cash flow is coming from the expats who left for other countries in search for better-paid work.\n\tIn this situation, Bitcoin may be a sufficiently stable currency for El Salvador and its economy to rely upon. But this is a very small country from the point of view of the size of the economy, which will unlikely offset the global adoption of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, we can see continued predispositions for a growing adoption of Bitcoin around the world. The interstate commerce volumes have grown several times since the early 2000s, and electronic payments are becoming an ordinary thing.\n\tWhy Bitcoin still has room for improvement\n\tSome technological issues, however, make Bitcoin not a very practicable solution for retail payments. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism undermines Bitcoin’s transaction throughput. As a result, you often have to wait for your transaction to be processed for 10-30 minutes. Clearly, that is not acceptable for retail payments. Besides that, Bitcoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency that can easily change its price by 5% to 10% and even more in a single day.\n\tThis creates another issue for the merchants: they will have to change the price of their merchandise very swiftly, sometimes several times per day, which may cause major inconvenience for the business model. It will also require fast crypto-to-fiat conversion on the merchant’s side for effective business performance - if businesses carry on operating in fiat currencies, of course.\n\tHow to tackle Bitcoin’s flaws\n\tYes, we can pay for pizza or coffee with Bitcoin: PayPal, for example, has already allowed American residents to do so. As a method of paying for goods, Bitcoin cannot yet manage without the participation of traditional money, though. Bitcoin’s effective exchange rate is calculated at the time of purchase, the end user’s balance in Bitcoin depletes and the merchant is paid in USD or another fiat currency. In this method, the service provider takes on the volatility risk.\n\tAnother solution offered for solving the technological problems Bitcoin has is the second-layer Lightning Network that can process peer-to-peer transactions outside its blockchain. It has its own system of nodes that can create channels between two Bitcoin wallets.\n\tThe transactions occurring in those channels would not go into Bitcoin’s blockchain, which could offload the main Bitcoin network. Also, transactions in Lightning Network occur very quickly and cost much less than the ones on the blockchain.\n\tHowever, there are some serious issues which may compromise this network's performance and security: low incentives for LN nodes and malicious attacks through channel congestion.\n\tWill Bitcoin go to the next level?\n\tEl Salvador may be the first to tread the road to Bitcoin adoption as legal tender, but it is still questionable whether this trend would expand to other countries. In the first place, Bitcoin was unlikely ever designed to be used as a means of everyday payment.\n\tWhile the situation is the way it is, Bitcoin may become more usable in large international money transfers but remain not very effective in retail trade.\n\tThe greater advantage of Bitcoin is in being used as a store of value - there is a reason it is often referred to as “digital gold”, after all. Traditional gold is considered a reliable store of wealth, but you won’t exactly see anyone bring a bar of gold to a coffee shop to pay for a cup of latte. It is not a convenient way of making payments in everyday life, which are usually small in volume, conducted frequently and need to be done swiftly.\n\tWhile we see a growing volume of BTC payments in the IT world, most people still have no experience with cryptocurrency transfers. So, it is hard to picture the masses suddenly adopting this novel payment method, as such global paradigm shifts take time.\n\tIt is important to continuously educate people on the benefits of new solutions. And the more people understand the benefits, the more retailers will be ready to use Bitcoin as a payment means. The growing number of participants in this market will blur the boundaries between the crypto and traditional economies and will make us look for new, interesting solutions. Paying for coffee with Bitcoin will most likely become a new reality.\n",

Two suspects intended to interfere in the prosecution by obtaining classified and confidential information from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York related to the ongoing federal criminal investigation and prosecution of a Chinese telecommunications company based in China.\n\tPer Reuters, citing a person familiar with the matter identified the Chinese company as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\n\tCurrently, two suspects are wanted by the FBI.\n\t“Far more than an effort to collect information or intelligence, the actions of the PRC intelligence officers charged in this case must be called out for what they are,” stated Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen\n\tAccording to the statement, the defendant is charged with two counts of money laundering based upon bribe payments totalling approximately $61,000 in Bitcoin, made in furtherance of the scheme.\n\tHowever, the recruit from a US law enforcement agency was actually working as a \"double agent\" under Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) supervision, according to the complaint.\n\tAttorney General Merrick Garland added in the statement, “This was an egregious attempt by PRC intelligence officers to shield a PRC-based company from accountability and to undermine the integrity of our judicial system.”\n\tSpeaking of Bitcoin Bribes, in 2020, A Russian police officer named Yuri Zaitsev was sentenced to eight years in prison for accepting a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bribe from a dark web drug dealer in exchange for his professional services.\n\tAs reported by Blockchain.News, the investigation started 2 years prior to his downfall. The former cop was reportedly the former head of the department for a drug trafficking task force operating under the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Republic of Khakassia. He was eventually found guilty of receiving a cryptocurrency bribe and disclosing State secrets.\n",

    "content": "\tMicroStrategy Inc plans to increase its bitcoin holdings through the net proceeds of its sale of up to $500 million worth of its class A shares.\n\tThe Tysons business software firm indicated their plan in September 9 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It disclosed a sales deal with Cowen and Company LLC and BTIG LLC to sell those shares from \"time to time.\"\n\tSEC filings say the proceeds will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin.\"\n\tAccording to the company, the new stock sale deal will not require MicroStrategy to issue any minimum offering amount. It further indicated in public filings that it expects to spend some of the proceeds on bitcoin purchases, but it did not make any promises about holding onto those purchases.\n\t\"We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, including with the net proceeds from this offering,\" the company wrote.\n\tThe firm \"may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments for treasury management purposes,\" the company wrote.\n\tAs of September 8, MicroStrategy held 129,699 bitcoins, whose market value at the time was worth well north of $2 billion.\n\tThe move has come a month after Michael Saylor - founder and Chairman of MicroStrategy - decided to step down as CEO.\n\tHowever, the company’s stock price is heavily affected by the rise and fall of the bitcoin price. The company has lost more than half its value since the beginning of the year — it stood at roughly $223 as of 3:00 pm Wednesday.\n\tIt is unknown how many bitcoin purchases the company has made since the end of June. However, it reported to the SEC that it had spent $10 million to buy 480 bitcoins between May 3 and June 28 - a small buy by the company’s standards.\n\tIn the first six months of 2021, MicroStrategy spent $1.6 billion to buy 34,616 bitcoins. According to SEC filings, the company purchased only 5,308 bitcoins in the first half of 2022.\n\tThe company has been looking to increase capital for bitcoin purchases over the past two years. In March 2022, a MicroStrategy subsidiary formed specifically to hold most of its bitcoin took on a $205 million loan to finance more purchases.\n\tThe company previously funded its bitcoin purchases with $1 billion in stock sales per an open-market sale agreement made in June 2021 with New York investment bank Jefferies LLC.\n\tThe total revenue of MicroStrategy for the second quarter of 2022 was $122.1 million - a decrease from $125.4 million during the same quarter a year earlier.\n\tWhile the company recorded a net loss of $1.2 billion compared to $409.4 million during the second quarter of 2021.\n",

    "content": "\tThe buzz around Coinbase's direct listing is slowly fading, causing investors to return to the home market of the crypto market. The market value of altcoins broke through $1 trillion for the first time, and the Maker successfully attracted the attention of investors.\n\tAmid the price hype surrounding COIN stocks, Bitcoin has successfully broken through the previous resistance level and stabilized at the level of $63K.\n\tThis phenomenon has also served to redirect traders' attention towards the crypto market, which has generated treated yields than the mainstream stock market.\n\tAccording to official sources, the first entity financing implementation proposal initiated by the MakerDAO governance facilitator and smart contract team has been passed on April 14 and will be implemented on April 16, UTC time. MakerDAO is a smart contract system on Ethereum, providing the first decentralized stable currency Dai (Ether U.S. Dollar) and derivative financial products. The proposal proposes to add a New Silver Series 2 DROP as Maker agreement collateral.\n\tNew Silver is a technology-first non-bank loan originator, focusing on financing real estate investors with fixed and flipped or small commercial assets. New Silver's proprietary technology automates and simplifies loan generation while using data to reduce the risk of default. In addition, New Silver's FlipScout tool uses intelligence to help find real estate investment projects with the highest return on investment. Investing in New Silver Series 2 DROP tokens means financing real estate in 39 states in the United States.\n\tAs soon as the news came out, the Maker rose in response. The price of Maker rose by more than 40% on April 15, hitting an all-time high of $4,096.57.\n\tMaker, the 42nd largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3,676,392,142, has risen by 35.33% with 24 hours and 65.49% in a week.\n\tAt the time of writing, the price has retraced and is trading at $3,035.\n\tMaker (MKR) Price Analysis\n\tJudging from the hourly candlestick chart, MKR is forming a bull flag shape with the 25% gain at the pink flagpole of this pattern. Currently, the price is consolidating between the $3,600 nearby, and gradually forming the purple flag of this pattern shown on the above chart.\n\tAccording to the increase of the upswing flagpole, this altcoin would likely exceed $4,500.\n\tHowever, the long upper shadow line drawn from the daily candlestick indicates that the upward pressure is still huge, and it will suffer a strong selling at its all-time high of $4,096.57.\n\tThe transaction price of MKR/USDT is higher than the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbon.\n\tBoth the upward floating moving average and the bearish MACD indicate that the bears are currently dominating the market.\n\tHowever, The Relative Strength Index stepping out of the overbought zone, forming a bearish signal that suggests that MKR is encountering strong selling pressure after touching its all-time high. The MKR’s price will experience a slight retracement, and it is likely to trade sideways for a period of time around $3,400 before resuming its upward momentum.\n\tIf the price can stabilize above $3,000, then the upward trend of Maker may open a faster upward channel. As Maker hit a new high- this will mean that the altcoin will not encounter strong selling pressure on its way up. It is very likely to break through $4097.57 in the short term.\n\tConversely, a surge in the number of sell orders will push MKR below the $3000 support level and may trigger a more severe correction to a 20-day EMA of $2560.\n",

    "content": "\tFacebook’s Libra drew fire as Senator Sherrod Brown likened it to the 2008 subprime mortgage fiasco.\n\tYahoo Finance has conveyed Senator Brown’s fierce sentiments about Libra as he recalled bankers proposed the innovative product that they deemed to be a game-changer. This would, however, not be the scenario as subprime mortgages instigated a turmoil.\n\tThe senator likened Facebook's Libra to subprime mortgages and projected that the pitch of assisting the underbanked and unbanked would similarly turn up a hoax.\n\tWithout a doubt, subprime mortgages were disastrous as millions of families lost their homes. As a result, the economy was wrecked and the nation’s “inequality” rose at an alarming rate. Brown projects that Libra will take a similar trajectory.\n\tLibra’s escalating pressure\n\tBrown stipulates that Facebook through Libra seeks to become the biggest bank globally. This is risky without proper regulations.\n\tNotably, Facebook has a user base of nearly a third of the globe’s population. As a result, if they were to utilize Libra, the present financial systems would be disrupted.\n\tPressure against Libra has been rising at an alarming rate. Specifically, different regulatory bodies have put up stringent measures.\n\tFacebook wavers\n\tAt the beginning of this week, Facebook gave hints that the Libra project was facing considerable constraints. As a result, it could not be launched.\n\tTherefore, the company has backtracked on earlier authoritative declarations of being the largest bank globally.\n\tAdditionally, prevailing data privacy outrages linked to Facebook have also escalated the pressure against Libra. Facebook’s present and proposed financial services have been blocked in China and India.\n\tMoreover, different countries have depicted significant concerns about Libra. Specifically, pressure has been rising against Facebook’s Libra project and this may jeopardize its existence.\n\tThere is no assurance Libra will be considered in a positive light as the firm has never made any significant investments in virtual currencies or blockchain.\n\tFacebook's Libra 'endangers' America\n\tLate in July 2019, a survey conducted on market sentiments for Libra suggested that the currency’s adoption rate is paltry.\n\tFacebook still expresses its willingness to address any concerns over the coin, mentioning that the reason for the early announcement of the launch was to accommodate requests and concerns raised by the US regulators.\n\tThe news comes as a major let-down for many cryptocurrency fans as Libra was believed to be the torch-bearer of significant crypto advancements in the years to come. For now, the uncertainty over its launching remains with the comment by Senator Brown thrown in.\n\tBrown’s comments echo those made by Republican crypto adversary Brad Sherman, who said Libra could ‘do more to endanger America than 9/11’ at a congressional hearing.\n\tWhat do you think could be the true motivation for launching Libra?

    "content": "\tOn Nov. 5, Fujitsu revealed its collaboration with Rice Exchange (Ricex), a Switzerland-based startup, for the first-ever blockchain-powered rice trading platform. This move seeks to offer unparalleled traceability, efficiency, transparency, and security to the worldwide rice market worth a whopping $450 billion.\n\tRicex offers a digital platform powered by the blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) for purchasing and selling rice. As a result, it provides a system where service providers, sellers, and buyers can interact and conduct efficient trades through a digital environment. Additionally, the platform enables them to arrange for inspection, shipping, insurance, and settlement.\n\tInefficiencies in the rice market\n\tDespite rice being one of the most traded agricultural products globally, it is profoundly marred with inefficiencies. For instance, paperwork characterizes transactions occurring in the market, and they are deemed slow and erroneous.\n\tFurthermore, the presence of a wide range of rice is another challenge because each strain differs in fragrance, taste, and quality.\n\tBlockchain platform to streamline the rice market\n\tThe blockchain platform availed by Ricex seeks to revamp the highly fragmented rice market by injecting new levels of efficiency and trust. As a result, it will create immutable and authentic data for all stakeholders, such as regulators, insurers, inspectors, shippers, sellers, and buyers.\n\tFor instance, buyers will be able to search for certified rice, and this will maximize their satisfaction rates.\n\tThe head of the Fujitsu Blockchain Innovation Center, Frederik De Breuck, noted:\n\t“Sustainability, track and trace, and provenance are at the heart of the Rice Exchange, which is another powerful example of the real-world use cases for blockchain. Ricex has shown great vision in adopting Fujitsu’s approach to distributed ledgers as a supplementary layer in larger enterprise architectures, and not an end-to-end solution by themselves. We have placed a focus on making sure the DLT can interoperate with existing infrastructures. This is how we deliver true value from investment in this exciting new technology.”\n\tAdditionally, the DLT structure will eliminate delays and frictions in the supply chain making transparency and security inevitable in the rice market.\n",

    "author": "Kun Hu",
    "content": "\tBlockchain's unique tamper-proof feature can simplify the voting process and remove reliance on trusted third parties through shared consensus, thus reducing costs in voting and disputes between both parties.\n\tTrust is missing\n\tAlthough Associated Press and other media have announced the 2020 US election results, disputes about the Trump and Biden election seem far from being settled.\n\tWithout substantial evidence, Trump's recent tweets are almost alike conspiracies surrounding mail-in ballots, rigged election, and vote recount. Unverified claims remain and have been shared widely.\n\tWhat's behind the chaos is a lack of trust in authoritative institutions like media companies, voting institutions, and even judicial courts. When authorities in power are not trustworthy, enter blockchain.\n\tWhy blockchain can be a consensus for both parties\n\tThese authoritative institutions are \"trusted third parties\", a term used in Bitcoin's whitepaper that describes trust intermediary.\n\tWe can see the drawbacks of trusted third parties - we have to delegate our rights and rely on them to do the right thing and follow established laws and regulations. But those in power also have the incentives to benefit themselves which could undermine the interests of the general public.\n\tBlockchain, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin, has a unique feature: it is tamper-proof which is primarily guaranteed by a combination of a distributed system, consensus, and encryption. When you write something on the blockchain, you can never modify and delete it. This is the first time humankind can hold such ability with technology.\n\tWhen it comes to the blockchain voting system, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party can make a joint effort to create a blockchain system, which can then be used in other elections as well. This way, we transform our trust in institutions and people involved in the voting process, and transfer it to blockchain-powered trusted machines, with its tamper-proof feature proven by mathematics.\n\tHow blockchain could change voting\n\tBlockchain can reshape the whole voting process.\n\tIt simplifies the voting process. With blockchain, you don't need to go to the voting station or mail-in ballots. Instead, you can vote on your phone. As this is more convenient, it encourages more inclusivity of voting people. It removes mail-in ballot deadline problems and any questions of rigged operations around USPS.\n\tIt removes doubts on voter fraud. The presidential election result has stirred doubt and uncertainty among many, including celebrities. For instance, John McAfee hints at election fraud from a Spanish prison, tweeting, \"Government bureaucrats can store documents, modify them, erase them, or, if it suits them, create them out of thin air. Do not forget that votes are documents.”\n\tWith blockchain, fraudulent claims that dead people voted in the election can be settled once and for all as well. Unless you know the passwords of the phone and blockchain voting app, and vote through them, the argument that dead people voted is refuted - dead people cannot vote.\n\tBlockchain may remove reliance on voting systems like Dominion. There is a rumor that through Dominion, 2.7 million votes were deleted and hackers modified the result. With the blockchain voting system, there is no way of deleting any votes and its network is much harder to hack than centralized voting systems.\n\tProfund impact of blockchain voting\n\tThe transparency and fairness of the presidential election is the backbone of democracy. A blockchain-based voting system can guarantee transparency and fairness and thus reduce the huge costs involved in the voting process and voting disputes. It can help enhance democracy and rebuild trust.\n\tBlockchain voting can be extended to other elections. Furthermore, with blockchain's tamper-proof and transparency features, it can be used by other government services. It is a process of reducing government roles. With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, a blockchain-empowered society may be emerging where we reduce our reliance on trusted institutions and centralized powers in charge.\n",

    "content": "\tAs China moves to cement its influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to further strengthen cooperation and promote a “digital Silk Road” with ASEAN member states.\n\tOn November 27, President Xi assured the Asian leaders that China’s top priority is to develop its relationship with the Asean (Associations of Southeast Asian Nations) – 10 countries in the Southeast Asian region including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Myanmar.\n\tXi’s speech comes just two days after President-elect Biden announced that his foreign policy agenda would see the U.S strengthens its relations and initiate a new leadership role in the Asia-Pacific.\n\tWhile speaking via a video link to partners and participants at the China-ASEAN Expo in the Southwest Chinese city of Nanning, Xi said:\n\t“China regards Asean as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and a key area for high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative.”\n\tXi said this while referring to his Belt and Road initiative project to build infrastructure, investment, and trade along both ancient maritime and land Silk Roads (sea and land routes connecting South Asia and East Asia with Persia, South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and Southern Europe).\n\tXi mentioned that China aims to collaborate with Asean nations to develop a “China-Asean digital port to promote digital connectivity, and build a ‘digital Silk Road’.”\n\tXi revealed his plans to lead China towards building close relationships with Asean to address pressure from the prolonged trade war caused by US President Trump in 2018.\n\tChina Embracing Blockchain Technology\n\tSo far there is no suggestion that the digitalization would involve the use of blockchain technology. However, President XI previously praised and regarded the technology as a breakthrough application, saying that China should seize opportunities presented by blockchain. Xi reiterated the importance of blockchain and the need to accelerate the development of the technology in the country in various sectors. Over 500 blockchain projects have been registered with China’s government.\n\tChina is poised to take the lead in blockchain after the country’s leader President Xi gave a strong backing to the technology. The move sets to allow the world’s second-largest economy to control the development of the nascent technology in the absence of competition from the U.S and Europe.\n\tAs China seeks to develop closer ties and trade relations in the Asean region, it is possible that the digital yuan, a CBCD project by China’s Central Bank, would be accepted in these countries. China intends to build a payment network autonomous from the U.S dollar, which remains the most popular medium for international business transactions. As the world moves to digital, China authorities remain committed to launching digital yuan so that the CBDC could get dominance by facilitating cross-border transactions in the region.\n",

    "content": "\tPower Ledger, a Perth-based energy trading software company, and Powerclub, an Australian electricity wholesaler, have signed a deal to offer households unparalleled authority over their energy usage via blockchain.\n\tPower ledger is famed for its blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer framework that prompts energy trading between households. The commercial partnership, therefore, seeks to enable Powerclub users to pool their net battery and solar storage as this will serve as a virtual power plant (VPP). This will make them attain considerable access to wholesale electricity prices prompting more control over what they pay per their energy consumption.\n\tThe blockchain-enabled VPP technology availed by Power Ledger will permit Powerclub households possessing batteries to pool their stored solar power and sell it whenever price spikes and high energy demands are witnessed.\n\tThe Australian Urge for Energy Trading Platforms\n\tThe Energy Market Commission in Australia has already spelled out the urge for future grids to act as energy trading platforms.\n\tJemma Green, the chairman, and co-founder of Power Ledger stipulated: “The Australian Energy Market Commission has already flagged the need for grids of the future to become energy trading platforms. The future of the energy industry will be decentralized and democratized, like what we’ve seen happen to the taxi industry with rideshare apps like Uber and Ola. You no longer need to be a massive electricity company to commoditize energy,”\n\tUnder the present system, energy consumers do not get value for money as the electricity retailer usually subjects them to additional hidden costs and mark-ups to cater for supply costs. This approach makes high energy prices inevitable in Australia.\n\tPowerclub’s CEO, Stuart McPherson, stipulated: “If there’s one thing that Powerclub stands by, it’s transparency. We’ve partnered with Power Ledger as we see their technology as being critical in reducing price opacity in the energy market.”\n\tThe blockchain-driven virtual power plant, therefore, seeks to offer households transparency about their energy consumption, as well as empower them economically.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Australian state of New South Wales is exploring a “flexible” regulatory reform for blockchain and other emerging technologies in the state.\n\tThe proposed blockchain regulation reform is being pushed by New South Wales’ Department of Treasury and the proposals were published in a research paper released by the department on Tuesday, July 28.\n\tAs described in the research paper, the rising global traction blockchain and digital currencies are gaining has necessitated the need to revise New South Wales regulations in order to be well-positioned to accommodate the growth. Such regulatory models will help provide a “flexibility” that will not hamper the growth potentials of firms with the yearnings to grow.\n\t“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how rapidly circumstances can change. It has presented significant and unprecedented challenges to people, organizations, and markets globally. Governments had to quickly respond with more flexible regulation to address the health, social and economic impacts of the pandemic. The NSW Government responded with a raft of temporary regulatory changes to protect citizens while allowing businesses to flexibly deliver their products and services and enabling ongoing legal and administrative requirements to be met through digital solutions,” New South Wales Treasury Secretary Michael Pratt AM said in a statement.\n\tAustralia is Pushing More Inclusive Regulations\n\tDigital currencies are becoming a commonplace in Australia as the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment means is contributing to the obvious transition to a digital economy. As much as there are positive upticks in the country, so are there cases of fraud as possible in crypto-centric economies. With these developments, Australian blockchain stakeholders are calling for an inclusive blockchain regulatory supervision.\n\tThe New South Wales regulatory proposal which will be employing a co-regulation, where the industry develops its own arrangements, which would subsequently be underpinned by government legislation will serve as a viable template for which other Australian states can model.\n",

    "content": "\tCOSIMO Ventures, an investment firm situated in Boston and Dublin, recently announced that the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has endorsed them with a seven-figure investment.\n\tThe company disclosed in a recent securitized announcement with Blockchain.news that the venture capital firm was working on developing their new blockchain-focused tokenized trust, dubbed COSIMO X.\n\tManaging Partner of COSIMO Ventures, Robert Frasca asserted that this was the first time any university in the United States had ever directly invested in a tokenized venture fund, making RIT the first university to hold a direct tokenized economic interest in a digital security firm. He also went on to express on behalf of COSIMO Ventures that with RIT’s funding, the investment firm hoped to achieve new heights of growth and breakthrough in the development of decentralized software protocols.\n\tThe Managing Partner also backed the newly instilled blockchain-focused tokenized fund—COSIMO X—and expressed this as a great opportunity of growth for his firm’s investors:\n\t“We believe that the growth that we can foster as an investment firm will be what really resonates with our investors. Once the market fully understands the benefits of tokenization as it relates to fund investing, a structure like ours might become the market standard.”\n\tBlockchain Future Powered by COSIMO X\n\tCOSIMO X, the blockchain-driven fund developed by COSIMO Ventures, is focused on investing in emerging businesses that utilize digital assets and blockchain protocols. Through these means, they hope to fuel and help the growth of the emerging digital economy. With exposure to companies working in regulatory technology industries, new digital asset creation sectors, and market infrastructure platforms, the COSIMO X fund is focused on utilizing financial technology as a tool to revolutionize and dominate the market.\n\tCOSIMO X Tokens, which are utilized on the blockchain platform, are representative of economic interest in the evergreen fund in this case and are found via the Securitize powered COSIMO X website. The tokens can be purchased by institutions, international investors, and US accredited investors.\n\tEthereum and Venture Capital\n\tWith fintech on the rise, startup companies that are funded by venture capital firms are integrating blockchain platforms more and more into their business ecosystem. As reported by Leadblock Partners, Ethereum seem to be a popular choice among European blockchain startups. Companies favor this particular blockchain network, because it offers robustness, scalability and overall stable architecture.\n",

    "author": "Drishti Bhagat",
    "content": "\tInspired by traditional index funds' success, Crypto20 (C20) was designed to reinvent how investors gain exposure to the broader crypto market. With cryptocurrencies long-term growth potential, an index fund is the perfect entry point for investors looking to generate exceptional returns without taking on excessive risk. Historically, passively managed index funds have outperformed comparable active funds. With the crypto market’s incredible growth, it'll be interesting to compare the index funds of the future to the previous generation.\n\tInvictus Capital’s C20 was the world's first cryptocurrency-only tokenized index fund which revolutionized investing in the crypto space. The Fund gives investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of the top 20 cryptos by market cap in a single, tradable token that can be liquidated at any time through the Invictus Investor Platform. C20 rebalances its positions weekly — a frequency optimized using data science techniques. By leveraging the efficiency enabled by the blockchain, the Fund is able to offer extremely competitive fees of 0.5% annually, whereas the industry average is 3%.\n\tWhile Crypto20 was the first, Crypto10 Hedged (C10) promises to be the next evolution of crypto index funds. It has many of the benefits of the original C20 with a dynamic cash hedge that offers upside exposure and downside protection for a smoother risk-return profile. This extra downside protection makes investing in cryptos more palatable for risk-averse investors. The cash held as a hedge during market downturns is used to generate additional revenue through margin lending. This enhances the Fund's performance while at the same time effectively reducing downside risk.\n\tPerformance\n\tFuelled by the crypto market's explosive growth in recent months, C20 and C10 have generated phenomenal returns of 394.80% and 311.67% over the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 also had an exceptional year by equities standards with a return of 29.25% (Yahoo Finance). The massive disparity in these funds' return potential goes to illustrate why cryptos have become so attractive to retail investors. It's possible to 4x your investment in a single year by investing in an index fund that tracks the broader crypto market. In comparison, the stable returns of traditional asset classes appear far less enticing.\n\tRisk\n\tCryptos are an inherently risky asset class, so reducing volatility is vital in order to make cryptos more accessible to a wider range of investors. This is what makes Invictus's crypto index funds so appealing because they have the fundamental benefit of having a high level of diversification, together with downside protection strategies in C10’s case. C10 is at its core about managing downside risk as its cash hedge allows investors the advantage of upside volatility while aiming to protect gains during periods of market stress. Both of Invictus's crypto index funds use weekly rebalancing, and they cap the weightings of a single crypto to ensure that no one asset dominates the portfolio, further improving the portfolio's diversification. While volatility in the crypto market is unavoidable, with this volatility comes opportunity. The 30-day realised volatility for C20 and C10 are considerably higher compared to the S&P 500, which indicates a greater risk profile. For investors willing to bear this additional risk, they have the potential to generate far superior returns.\n\tInvictus Capital has pioneered the next generation of index funds. The remarkable performance of C10 (420.40%) and C20 (153.06%) since their inception have shown that crypto index funds have a bright future ahead.\n\tInvestors can generate additional returns by staking their Invictus tokens.\n\tClick here to learn more about ICAP tokens.\n",

These eternal words, spoken in the novelized version only, hint at a vast new universe where human beings become something else, something entirely and eternally new. Hold on to that concept for now.\n\tPeople began hearing the word blockchain circa 2008. Over ten years ago now, but barely a drop in the boundless stream of time. This nascent technology soon planted its terrestrial roots and spread around many industrial sectors. These roots are now deeply entrenched, and while blockchain has become somewhat of an overused buzzword across certain quarters, the technology is sound. Blockchain is slowly coming of age, so it is time for it to start looking skywards and reach for the stars.\n\tHouston, we have blockchain: Decentralized technology breaking earthly bounds\n\tAs of 2019, spacefaring remains an expensive and very -very- risky enterprise. Several high-profile disasters, such as the loss of the Challenger and Columbia shuttles in 1986 and 2003 respectively, served as stark reminders that venturing into space can be a life or death situation with potentially disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, the space race continues, and several projects currently in development aim to send a manned mission to Mars sometime in the 2030s. Whether such a mission does come to lift-off within the planned timeframe remains to be seen, but space-related projects based on more feasible achievements are already underway through blockchain technology.\n\tBlockchain tech has already proved its viability down here on Earth. It started off as the engine that powered the development of cryptocurrencies, before evolving into something far more versatile. Industries such as entertainment, supply chain, medical, airlines, banking, and many other sectors have already seen the advantages that a blockchain platform can afford.\n\tBlockchain's main raison d'etre is decentralization. The disruption of the status quo through transparency and fairness. And the potential applications of this technology for space-related industries are as vast as space itself.\n\tSpace: The new frontier for entrepreneurship\n\tSpace is a huge expanse full of stars, worlds, nebulae, black holes, and probably myriad civilizations that we just have not been able to discover yet. The final frontier, as some say, and blockchain technology is ready and poised to take humanity where it has never gone before.\n\tBut let's roll back the dice of time sixty off years. Back then, the issue of space exploration was firmly in the hands of the superpowers of the era. The United States and the then Soviet Union scrambled to put a man into space. The Soviets won, as Yuri Gagarin completed one full orbit around Planet Earth on the Vostok capsule on April 12, 1961, though the Americans did manage to put the first human on the Moon.\n\tNASA in the United States, Roscosmos in Russia, and the European Space Agency (ESA) were, for a long time, the main players in the worldwide space industry. In other words, this sector was hugely centralized, and to an extent, monopolized. This monopoly was somewhat justified due to the astronomical cost of space-related R&D, which only government-sponsored agencies could afford to bear. But recent technological developments have enabled smaller companies to become active players in the space field. The name of this holy grail? Blockchain, of course.\n\tBlockchain tech has given many entrepreneurial minds, something that established names like NASA did not: An opportunity to thrive and develop their ideas. Blockchain opened a gateway for the creation of value, to find new ways to do business, paving the way to the stars, quite literally in this case.\n\tPractical applications of blockchain in space: Satellite communication, online shopping, and everything in between\n\tCueing back to the present day, blockchain has enabled two key aspects: democratization and decentralization of space.\n\tBut one question remains. Who exactly owns space, and who is entitled to do business up there? A number of international treaties signed in the 1960s intended space to be ‘humankind’ property. In other words, no one nation could claim a unique stake in it, no matter how many flagpoles were erected on the Moon or elsewhere. This, while certainly a fair and romantic notion, is far from the cold financial reality. Space is open for business, and anyone who can afford to put a spacecraft in orbit is likely to claim ownership of at least a small patch of vacuum. Fortunately, there are plenty of patches up for grabs.\n\tAnd this is where blockchain comes in. The decentralization power of this technology is perfectly suited for the needs of a sprawling orbital network of satellites, for example. But this network would generate a gargantuan amount of data, which would need to be analyzed and processed. Blockchain would provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure to support data processing.\n\tData processing and sharing is an interesting aspect of blockchain, particularly when applied to spacefaring. Long journeys, such as the planned manned mission to Mars, would generate and use large datasets. There currently is little or no satellite coverage on Mars, but future blockchain-powered networks could provide essential navigation information, for instance. And the possibilities go far beyond the confines of our own world. Blockchain could indeed become the fulcrum upon which rest the data sharing facilities on Mars' surface, should a permanent human colony ever be established there.\n\tCrypto-economy across the solar system, and what lies beyond\n\tBlockchain started life as the driving force behind cryptocurrencies. It has steadily evolved into something much more complex and far-reaching, and the next natural evolutionary step aims to conquer space.\n\tThe current economic framework here on Earth is largely driven by banks, which have enjoyed a hitherto uncontested hegemony on the financial realm. Not so anymore. The emergence of cryptocurrencies has defied the bank's former monopoly of wealth, and by extension, economic activity.\n\tThe global turnover for the space economy grew from just over $216bn in 2009 to over $410bn in 2018. This figure will only keep growing as more players become involved in the space race. Well-known names such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic both already operate the space-faring craft, for example.\n\tUsing blockchain beyond Earth's boundaries gives rise to an interesting proposition: The creation of a crypto-economy in space. Free of banks' shackles, an economic system powered by blockchain would flourish. Satellites placed at strategic points along a given route could be used to carry out transactions bypassing spacecraft. Payment of salaries, online shopping, and other amenities, could be available on board thanks to the power of blockchain.\n\tConclusion\n\tBlockchain technology recently turned a decade old, so it's still relatively in its infancy. To put this into perspective, telephone technology has been around for about 140 years. In other words, there is no telling what blockchain can do at this point.\n\tThe democratization of space economy is worth the entry price alone, but alongside blockchain's other traits such as transparency, speed, and security, make it the perfect candidate to become a pioneering endeavor for the benefit of all mankind. The future is indeed full of stars.\n",

    "content": "\tKey Takeaways\n\tSFC's Dual Role in Asset Management\n\tChristina Choi, Executive Director of Investment Products at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), addressed the Bloomberg Buy-Side Forum in Hong Kong on September 26, 2023. She outlined the SFC's dual role: protecting investors and upholding market integrity, and strengthening Hong Kong's position as a global asset management hub. The SFC aims to balance regulation and innovation, ensuring that technology advancements like AI and blockchain can be integrated into the asset management industry without compromising market integrity.\n\tTechnology's Impact on Asset Management\n\tChoi highlighted the rapid advancements in technology, specifically mentioning the miniaturization of chip technology from 90 nanometres to just three nanometres in two decades. She linked these technological leaps to the potential for \"tiny changes\" in the asset management industry that could result in significant market development.\n\tTokenization of Retail Investment Products\n\tOne of the most notable points in Choi's speech was the discussion on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products. Tokenization refers to the use of blockchain technology to create digital tokens that represent fractional ownership in an investment product. Choi mentioned that the SFC is currently working on detailed guidelines for tokenization, particularly focusing on primary dealing at this stage due to the nascent state of Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs) in Hong Kong.\n\tRegulation Enables Innovation\n\tChoi stressed that while innovation is crucial, it must be balanced with robust regulation to ensure sustainable development and investor protection. She cited historical examples like the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08 and the fallout of unregulated crypto platforms to emphasize the importance of regulation.\n\tClosing Remarks\n\tIn her closing remarks, Choi drew an analogy between regulation and machine learning, stating that just as \"machine learning without regularization\" is problematic, so is \"innovation without regulation.\"\n\tDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

    "content": "\tOn October 30, 2023, Snowtrace.io, a popular blockchain explorer tool dedicated to the Avalanche C-Chain, announced that it would be discontinuing its Etherscan-powered explorer effective from November 30, 2023 (00:00 UTC). This announcement came through a series of tweets from Snowtrace's official Twitter handle, @SnowTraceHQ. The Snowtrace team expressed their gratitude towards the Avalanche community (@avax) for their support over the last two years.\n\tThe Snowtrace team stressed the importance of backing up crucial information. They specifically urged users to save backups of Private Name Tags and Contract Verification details before the discontinuation date. An official reminder was also issued 17 hours before the post, reiterating the urgency to backup such information, linking to a page on Etherscan's website for further details regarding the discontinuation of the blockchain explorer.\n\tAlthough the official announcement did not clarify the reason behind the discontinuation, some individuals within the crypto community speculated that the high service costs associated with Etherscan's Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework could be a driving factor. Mikko Ohtama, Co-founder of Trading Strategy, estimated the annual EaaS subscription cost to be between one to two million dollars, potentially making it a costly endeavor for Snowtrace to continue its operations under the existing framework.\n\tAmidst the buzz, Phillip Liu Jr., the Director of Strategy and Operations at Ava Labs, commented on the development. He mentioned that the protocol is transitioning to \"something better\" and affirmed that operations would \"absolutely not\" cease, indicating a probable shift to an alternative solution for blockchain exploration.\n\tThe episode underscores the dependencies and potential challenges faced by blockchain explorers leveraging Etherscan’s EaaS framework. It sheds light on the importance of renewing service agreements, ensuring sufficient bandwidth, and maintaining adequate traffic to keep a block explorer operational. The Snowtrace scenario serves as a strong reminder to users about the significance of backing up their data, especially when utilizing third-party services for blockchain exploration.\n\tWhile the exact future of Snowtrace remains uncertain, the proactive communication from its team regarding the discontinuation and urging users to backup their data demonstrates a responsible approach towards handling such transitions. The anticipation now pivots towards what alternative solutions will emerge to fill the void left by Snowtrace's discontinuation and how Ava Labs plans to navigate this change.\n",

    "content": "\tWith Ethereum 2.0’s first phase (Phase 0) anticipated to launch on December 1, it appears that there is still a lot of Ether (ETH) missing for the blockchain upgrade to happen.\n\tIn order for Ethereum 2.0 to come into play, a minimum of 32 Ether per validator needs to be locked into the deposit contract. This translates to roughly $14,825.00 per validator or staking pool, per Ether’s current price on CoinMarketCap. In anticipation of Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0, which will feature a beacon chain, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has dedicated 3,200 ETH to Ethereum 2.0, which translates roughly to $1.4 million in today’s prices.\n\tHowever, a huge chunk of ETH investments is still missing for the blockchain upgrade to happen. On-chain data analytics tracking smart contract deposits have reported that only 18.6% of needed ETH has been locked in as of now. Per the source:\n\t“98,203 ETH has been staked in the Eth2 deposit contract. 426,085 more ETH is needed to launch Eth2.”\n\tFor Ethereum 2.0’s phase 0 upgrade to launch successfully, a total of over 524,000 ETH needs to be locked in by validators before November 24 – 7 days before the anticipated release date. If that is not accomplished, plans for Ethereum 2.0 mainnet’s genesis will once again be delayed.\n\tValidator participation has been an ongoing issue on Ethereum’s testnets, namely Medalla and Spadina. Both testnets have seen lower than expected participation levels, but Ethereum developers have been hoping that it would not be an issue on ETH 2.0, as real Ether will be at stake, so to speak.\n\tWhat's at stake on Ethereum 2.0 mainnet\n\tEthereum 2.0 mainnet is expected to launch on December 1, if all goes well. Though phase 0 will not operate entirely according to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, it will be the first step in transitioning towards a pure PoS model.\n\tAs opposed to a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, the underlying model behind Bitcoin, a proof-of-stake consensus model will depend on a staker to validate new transactions.\n\tThe staker will be determined based on the amount of tokens they have locked into the deposit contracts. More stakes will translate to higher rewards and privileges. If a given investor does not have enough Ether to stake on Ethereum 2.0 mainnet, staking pools are always a viable option, which will enable multiple stakeholders to combine their resources and earn block rewards on the new blockchain.\n\tEthereum 2.0 is set to launch in three phases so that the chain can be perfected bit by bit. The current Ethereum blockchain, which follows a PoW consensus model, will also operate in parallel with ETH 2.0 for the time being. Scalability is also expected to be improved on the new blockchain.\n\tWith the mainnet’s anticipated launch, Ether may surge even more, as more traders onboard Ethereum in anticipation of its success.\n\tCurrently, ETH has surpassed the $400 mark as expected and is trading at $463,31 on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Bank of Korea (BoK), South Korea’s central bank and monetary issuer, has released its research on the use of digital currencies and blockchain technology for the banking industry.\n\tAs reported by local publication Chosun on May 19, the bank recognized the progress in state-backed digital currencies, popularly called CBDCs, and their benefits in the broader financial market.\n\tBoK’s “Overseas CDBC Progress” report analyzed 14 central banks working on digital currency projects, including major banks in Sweden, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan, among others. All analyzed banks were found to be either developing pilot projects or already testing digital currencies on a distributed system.\n\tThe report noted several aspects as reasons compelling a shift to digital currencies, such as faster and verifiable payment settlements, sharp declines in cash activity, and the advances in DLT-based systems.\n\tThe bank reported:\n\t\"Most central banks are focusing on research on whether new future-oriented technologies can be applied to CBDCs, away from the centralized ledger management and account-based transactions that are currently applied to payment and settlement systems.\"\n\tThe bank noted central banks around for the world are looking towards digital currencies for two primary reasons; 1. Making large-scale payments more efficient, and 2. Increasing financial inclusivity in developing countries.\n\tBanks in Europe, the Caribbean islands, and China are focussed on building infrastructure and applications for local digital currency usage, such as those between individuals, vendors, and micro-businesses.\n\tFrance, Hong Kong, and Thailand have grander aspirations. Banks in these countries want to handle large sums for customers, such as remittances, import-export, shipping, and general trade.\n\tThe report noted China and Sweden are in advanced stages of development and have completed a “proof-of-concept,” with the next step being a pilot study. Meanwhile, the central bank of Bahamas has already shifted to a trial stage, with no issues published currently.\n\tFor use in its CBDC project, Bank of Korea will utilize “various” enterprise DLT platforms, such as R3 Coda and Hyperledger Fabric. Ethereum and Ripple, two blockchain projects famous for enterprise usage, were not mentioned or included in plans as of now.\n",

    "content": "\tPolkadot has caught widespread attention among blockchain project investors recently. Founded by Ethereum Co-founder Gavin Wood and managed by Web3 Foundation, Polkadot recently completed its private token sale with 500,000 DOT tokens at the valuation of $1.2 bn.\n\tClaimed as the candidate of Decentralized Web 3.0 Blockchain interoperability platform, what makes Polkadot so popular? We are glad to speak with Jack Platts, Head of Collaborations of Web3 Foundation to share with us how Polkadot is interoperable with Bitcoin! He also explains the GRANDPA protocol of Polkadot and how Polkadot can interact with Ethereum!\n\tTo start off, can you briefly introduce Polkadot to our readers?\n\tPolkadot attempts to abstract away security and interoperability so that a higher level, user-facing applications can focus on building products. We think of Polkadot as an infrastructure for infrastructure. Polkadot is developer-facing, and kind of handles the connection between many disparate blockchains, economies, and markets. You can think of it like the UN or the United States Federal Government, where the countries or states contribute but ultimately have their own fiefdoms and control over how their citizens live.\n\tTalking about Polkadot, the project of Web 3 Foundation. Can you elaborate on what is GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) consensus?\n\tGRANDPA is the finality gadget used in Polkadot. It’s also a Substrate Runtime Module so anyone building a blockchain, whether for Polkadot or not, can use it too. The research team at Web3 Foundation created GRANDPA so that Polkadot could be scalable and secure. Rob Habermeier wrote a great blog post on the intricacies of GRANDPA and Alistair Stewart wrote a more technical paper for anyone interested. I’d encourage folks interested in consensus to check those out, as well as our Wiki.\n\tPolkadot claims that it allows interaction with smart contracts in Ethereum. Can you elaborate on this can be done?\n\tWeb3 Foundation is providing grants to teams building bridges. One of the first bridges will be to Ethereum, but it’s important to note that Polkadot is not a smart contracts platform. It’s a networking protocol, a kind of trade a security agreement between blockchains. So by bridging in Ethereum, and having native parachains that provide smart contracts like Edgeware, all other blockchains connected to Polkadot can use smart contracts and the state of those contracts, too.\n\tHow to achieve interoperability between Polkadot and Bitcoin?\n\tThis would be done via a bridge chain. Polkadot can connect any previously existing blockchain if it matches two criteria:\n\tBitcoin and Bitcoin-like chains fall short on these characteristics. To address the first criteria, Polkadot validators can simply run a full Bitcoin node. To address the second criteria, either a soft-fork allowing extra-protocol controls over funds or a hard-fork enabling a threshold-signature-friendly signing scheme such as Schnorr is needed. Neither are impossible goals, however, a significant degree coordination would be required to achieve them.\n",

    "content": "\tA Russian Court recently ruled a Bitcoin theft case as innocent, stating that Bitcoin was not considered property. The victim sought restitution, after being robbed of 100 Bitcoins. If this case were to be tried in another country, the jurisdiction would have ruled it as a felony.\n\tHowever, the Russian court dismissed the motion, stating that Bitcoin was a virtual currency and therefore does not enjoy the same property protection as other types of assets.\n\tThe Petrograd District Court of St. Petersburg argued that the culprit, Peter Piron, was innocent and not charged for cryptocurrency fraud. The pretext was that the court declared the claim to be unrecognized under Russian law since virtual currencies are not recognized in Russia.\n\tLegal Reign- Politics\n\tRussia’s blockchain e-voting platform for President Vladimir Putin’s proposed Constitutional amendments reportedly suffered a node attack recently. If the proposal is accepted, Vladimir Putin will be allowed to serve as Pr will allow Putin to serve as President until 2036.\n\tAs previously reported by Blockchain.News, prior to this time, Russia was perceived to be making moves in setting up a better regulatory framework around cryptocurrency; one could say that the disposition of the Russian government towards cryptocurrencies remains unclear with several ministries, and the central bank is alleged to be working towards agreeing to a ban on cryptocurrency.\n\tRussia Divided in Opinion Concerning Bitcoin\n\tIn other news, Russia's State Duma openly declared that he hated cryptocurrencies as a whole, whether it be Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. If it was not in Ruble, Russia's official currency, or currency issued by a state, he stated that Russia's government would not be open to adopting it.\n",

    "content": "\tWith 27 mainland Chinese cities on lockdown, insurance providers have been relying on blockchain technology to fast track claims payouts during the coronavirus outbreak,which has taken over 800 lives, surpassing the death toll of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.\n\tXiang Hu Bao, an online mutual aid platform, a subsidiary of Ant Financial, is a “collective claims-sharing mechanism built on blockchain that offers basic health plans to its 104 million participants.” Most of its users are Chinese citizens from lower-tier cities, and in rural areas. By utilizing blockchain technology, settlements have been made more efficient, and fraudulent claims have been reduced.\n\tThe platform is also available on Alipay, another product owned by Ant Financial. The payout for coronavirus claims will be funded with Ant Finacial's capital, apart from the other 100 critical illnesses that the users of the Xiang Hu Bao are eligible for.\n\tAccording to the South China Morning Post, an Ant Financial representative from Beijing said,“Xiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and make payouts to participants quicker, due to the decentralized, trust-free nature of blockchain technology. Claim applicants can submit their supporting documents as evidence while investigation firms can get immediate access to them on the blockchain. All parties involved can see the entire process.”\n\tBlue Cross: Helping to ease pressure on healthcare services in Hong Kong\n\tWith over 30 confirmed cases in Hong Kong and one death, Blue Cross Asia Pacific Insurance, a subsidiary of the Bank of East Asia has been shortening the time spent on data verification. Its blockchain-based platform, which is able to handle more than 1,000 concurrent transactions in one second without human interaction has been helping to ease pressure on healthcare services in Hong Kong.\n\tThe platform has been launched since April 2019, there has been a record of double-digit growth of the number of policyholders using the app. By helping medical service providers to reduce the time spent on administrative duties, blockchain has been proven to be essential during the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.\n\t“Our blockchain-backed claims service has played a key role during the outbreak of the coronavirus by totally eliminating the paper process and the need for back-and-forth documents delivering to clinics. This really helps to mitigate the risk of infection from face-to-face contact,” said Patrick Wan, Managing Director of Blue Cross.\n\tInsurance and blockchain go hand in hand\n\tCB Insights Research indicated that although it is too early to tell whether blockchain technology can overcome the “legal and regulatory hurdles” to be adopted in the insurance industry, the “possibilities are endless, and insurance companies and startups alike are exploring insurance applications for the technology at full throttle.”\n\tInsurance fraud has been costing the industry $40 billion a year, leading to higher premiums and worse coverage for consumers. By moving insurance claims from paper contracts onto a distributed and immutable ledger, blockchain can enable the elimination of fraud in the industry, which has been costing $40 billion a year.\n\tEtherisc is a blockchain-based insurance product, powered by smart contracts, which was launched in October 2017, allowing passengers to purchase travel insurance using cryptocurrency or fiat (USD and Euros). Payouts were automatically transferred to the participants after a qualifying incident.\n\tBlockchain used for coronavirus donations\n\tChinese conglomerate Alibaba starteda $144 million fund to purchase medical supplies for Wuhan, the city of the epicenter of the outbreak while offering AI computing power to research organizations for creating vaccines and treatments. Tencent also created a $42.7 million fund for medical supplies to be used in Wuhan.\n\tHowever, there has been concern that the millions of dollars being donated for the public, as well as the protective equipment, are not being put to use where needed, and it has been reportedthat the equipment has been misdirected.\n\tAccording to Syren Johnstone, an academic at the University of Hong Kong, a private blockchain network would “enable the recording and tracking of anything that is donated, from donation dollars to N95 masks.” By holding the person or organization accountable, donations for delivery could be tracked from the donor all the way to its final-use. Blockchain would also enable transparency for the general public to understand how their donations have been used and its progress. While a private blockchain is strictly controlled, it can also allow for public transparency for donors and donees, as well as authorities.\n",

    "content": "\tRipple’s XRP token has been all the rage lately, making headlines left and right due to its relentless surge in the past week. Currently, its price has pulled back slightly, but the bull run and the talks revolving around XRP have benefited Ripple overall.\n\tAt the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP price has pulled back, down 30% on CoinMarketCap in the last 24 hours. However, blockchain analytics provider Santiment has asserted that XRP has excelled in one key area. Social discussions revolving around Ripple has escalated, especially lately.\n\tThe Ripple (XRP) effect\n\tFor the first time since April, Ripple may have pinned investors’ interest more than Ethereum (ETH), according to behavior analysis charts. Ripple has been talked about and discussed more than Ethereum lately, and this may be significant since it may indicate that market sentiment around XRP is growing stronger, potentially surpassing Ether (ETH) as a preferred digital asset investment. Per the announcement:\n\t“The daily social volume (mentions on #crypto platforms) of $XRP is on the verge of surpassing $ETH for the first time in 7 months. This crossover would be significant, as it signals change in interest level between the two assets, regardless of positivity.”\n\tAccording to the chart illustrated above, which displays Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple by social volume, or popularity, Ripple has captured increased investor interest and this digital asset may soon be mentioned more than Ethereum. The purple line is an indicator of Ripple’s social volume, with the orange one and blue one representing Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively.\n\tThe development of XRP Ledger, the underlying distributed ledger technology backing XRP, has increased in activity by five-fold, compared to 18 months ago.\n\tRipple’s price has gained new heights\n\tRipple’s social volume, as well as the technology company’s new projects, have coincided with the XRP token’s rise in price. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP gained by nearly 140% in a month. Its rise in price has been said to be influenced by many factors, per market experts.\n\tIn just a week’s time, Ripple’s XRP token outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the market, as it regained its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, after previously having been unseated by Tether (USDT).\n\tA stellar performance by XLM\n\tXRP is not the only altcoin that has been outperforming lately. Recently, Stellar Lumens (XLM) recorded gains of over 155% in a week, as it went through a protocol update. This was implemented by validators on the network and will provide a more seamless experience for users on the Stellar network.\n\tStellar Lumens is a modified fork of Ripple. It was also initiated by one of Ripple’s co-founders, Jed McCaleb. Similar to Ripple, Stellar also operates as a payment technology designed to connect financial institutions and improve cross-border payments through lower costs and improved time efficiency.\n\tEthereum has something up its sleeve too\n\tWith Bitcoin's recent bull run driving altcoins higher, who is to say whether or not Ripple may surpass Ethereum in terms of investment popularity in the long run. Currently, Ethereum awaits the launch of ETH 2.0 mainnet, which is less than a week away. With the new blockchain segment implemented on December 1, its native cryptocurrency Ether may increase in value.\n",

    "time": "2024-04-11",
    "author": "News Publisher",
    "content": "\tAs artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, concerns about bias within AI systems have garnered significant attention. Bias in AI refers to the systematic errors or inaccuracies in decision-making processes, often resulting from the unconscious prejudices of its developers or the data used to train the algorithms. Addressing bias in AI is crucial to ensuring fairness, equity, and safety across various applications, from hiring processes to judicial systems. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution to mitigate bias and enhance transparency in AI systems.\n\tAccording to a post by CyberGhost, human biases can significantly influence AI algorithms, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For instance, if AI systems are trained on biased datasets, they may perpetuate and amplify existing societal inequalities. This highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to address bias in AI and uphold ethical standards.\n\tBlockchain technology, known primarily for its association with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, offers a decentralized and transparent framework that can effectively combat bias in AI. Unlike traditional centralized systems, blockchain operates on a distributed ledger, where transactions are recorded across a network of computers. Each transaction, or in the case of AI, each decision made by the algorithm, is transparently recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and tamper-proof.\n\tOne way blockchain can ensure the safety of AI systems is through the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In a DAO, decisions are made collectively by a community of stakeholders rather than a single centralized authority. By integrating blockchain into AI governance models, decisions made by AI algorithms can be subjected to community scrutiny and consensus, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes.\n\tMoreover, blockchain enables the creation of transparent and auditable datasets for training AI algorithms. Data provenance, or the ability to trace the origin and history of data, is crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in AI. By recording data transactions on the blockchain, stakeholders can verify the authenticity and integrity of datasets, ensuring that they are free from bias or manipulation.\n\tFurthermore, blockchain-based smart contracts can be utilized to enforce fairness and accountability in AI systems. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In the context of AI, smart contracts can specify fairness criteria and penalties for biased decisions, thereby incentivizing developers to prioritize ethical considerations in algorithm design.\n\tImplementing blockchain technology in AI systems is not without its challenges. Scalability, interoperability, and energy consumption are among the technical hurdles that need to be addressed. Additionally, regulatory and legal frameworks surrounding blockchain and AI integration require careful consideration to ensure compliance with data protection and privacy laws.\n\tBias in AI poses significant risks to individuals and society at large, undermining trust and perpetuating discrimination. Blockchain technology offers a promising avenue for mitigating bias in AI systems through transparency, decentralization, and accountability. By leveraging blockchain's inherent features, we can foster more equitable and safe AI systems that uphold ethical principles and serve the greater good.\n",

    "content": "\tLisbon, Portugal, 20th July, 2022, Chainwire\n\tZharta, creator of a lending protocol for instant NFT collateralized loans, has closed a seed round of 4 million dollars in new capital to fuel the company's next phase of growth. The company had initially raised an acceleration round of $300,000 from angel investors.\n\tProminent investors include Lead Investor Greenfield One, followed by the institutional VCs Shilling Capital and Possible Ventures, core Web3 industry players SpaceShipDao and UniwhalesDao, as well as Clever, Olisipo Way, and other strategic Business Angels. This seed funding round was assisted by the Cuatrecasas Law Firm.\n\tZharta will allocate the new funds primarily to customer demands, followed by R&D, sales, and marketing. The goal is to accelerate market penetration and expand rollouts to improve the instant lending platform. To implement these goals, they will be adding up to 20 new hires to their current, 12-strong team.\n\tZharta has created a real-time lending model leveraged on Lending Pools and NFT appraisals with Machine Learning and aims at the DeFi and NFT native holders to quickly prove its platform’s potential, which the company ascribes to its 3 keystones: Simplicity, UX-oriented, and Trustworthy. Nuno Cortesão, Zharta’s co-founder and CEO, hopes that a strong customer-centric oriented foundation will enable them to expand: “We aim to deliver the best user-centric experience so that we can address a broader audience in the future,” said Nuno, “moving from early adopters to the mass market.”\n\tCurrently, the collections that can be collateralized are: Doodles, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club, World of Women, VeeFriends, Cool Cats, Hashmasks, and Pudgy Penguins, with “more collections being added in the near future”, guarantees the CEO.\n\tZharta has already gone through a testing phase, during which it has collected user feedback to launch a platform that meets consumers' wants, needs and concerns, enhancing the user experience. This phase also allowed them to solve security issues by auditing Smart-Contracts.\n\tZharta aims to leverage AI-appraisals and DeFi pools to fund NFTs. This includes existing assets such as collectables, but will also cover the emerging play2earn gaming, metaverse and art markets.\n\tEvincing a grounded and pragmatic mentality, Zharta is not profligate. It focuses on solid growth and providing the market with a robust value offering that is financially sustainable. It wishes to establish good partnerships in Web3 and build on the value others have created, becoming a vital piece of the whole, building complex primitives, and integrating with institutional players. Zharta envisages a future where TradFi and DeFi reliably collaborate and where digital assets are treated with full respect in the financial system.\n\tZharta’s platform’s official launch is expected to take place in Late Summer.\n\tAbout Zharta: Zharta is a unique blockchain protocol that offers a solution to the illiquidity problem faced by NFT holders. Thanks to its NFT-backed loans, Zharta enables the democratization of the market by allowing every collector and investor to stake their NFT assets in exchange for crypto tokens. The protocol is being built with a strong focus on security, and leverages AI price discovery mechanisms and on-chain index funds to further optimize liquidity, offering a more efficient way to trade NFTs. The project is spearheaded by a trio of entrepreneurs (Diogo Pires, Nuno Cortesão, and Pedro Granate) with vast expertise in computer sciences, business development, blockchain programming, and gamification theory. About Greenfield One Greenfield One is an Early-Stage Crypto Fund based in Berlin and was founded in 2018 by former VC Sebastian Blum and entrepreneur Jascha Samadi. The fund invests early in crypto networks and developer teams across Web 3.0 infrastructure, decentralized finance and NFT technology. Greenfield One pursues a very research-driven investment approach and also actively participates in the portfolio's crypto networks through its own technical infrastructure and liquidity. Greenfield One currently invests from its third fund, which is Europe's largest crypto fund, with 135 million euros in volume.\n\tWhere to find us:\n\tWebsite | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Medium\n",

    "time": "2020-04-01",
    "author": "Nicholas Otieno",
    "content": "\tEgypt is facing a severe cash crunch as the country is feeling the economic pressure of the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank of Egypt has instructed local banks to begin restricting daily withdrawals and has instructed citizens not to withdraw so much money. The central bank’s current move is aimed to prevent a cash shortage and to control inflation and hoarding during the spread of coronavirus. So far, the country has about 36 coronavirus deaths and 576 infections. The closures in the nation are likely to be extended indefinitely.\n\tVirus tests the limits of central bank power\n\tEgypt’s central bank is under tremendous pressure as citizens are flooding the local ATMs to withdraw massive sums of cash in panic attempts to stay prepared for the worst-case scenarios. This seems to leave extremely little cash with the central bank. Instead, the central bank has issued directives to the local banks to impose cash withdrawal limits. The central bank’s new guidelines indicate that individuals will have a daily cash withdrawal limit of 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($640), while Egyptian companies can withdraw up to 50,000 Egyptian pounds. There will be exceptions for companies in case the money is being utilized to pay employees. Further, the central bank has informed local banks to limit ATM withdrawals as consumers now can only deposit and withdraw 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($316) per day at ATMs.\n\tMoreover, the central bank has told citizens to avoid paper currency and rather to adopt electronic transfers and e-payments so that to control the coronavirus spread. As of 30th March, all banks canceled fees on e-payments and electronic transfers for the citizens’ convenience. The day prior, the central bank began an electronic payments initiative to encourage citizens to stop using physical currency (cash). All bank fees have been canceled in the country as the central bank instructed local banks to delay credit penalties against organizations and customers and not to impose late payments on certain loans.\n\tAlthough there is no evidence indicating that Egyptian citizens are turning to Bitcoin amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many people seem to validate the need for cryptocurrencies. However, the central bank promotes the use of electronic payments, specifically credit cards and not any digital asset.\n\tBlockchain as leverage to combat the coronavirus outbreak\n\tWhile the world continues looking for ways to address the coronavirus pandemic, blockchain technology has proved to provide important solutions. Coronavirus has caused havoc on the world’s economy, with banks not only in Egypt but also in the US, Lebanon, and several countries have imposed cash limits. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is seen to have a lot to offer to the world to combat the coronavirus crisis, like offering a good alternative investment option for people. It remains to see if the coronavirus pandemic is enough to weaken the whole banking sector and make people turn to digital form of money like cryptocurrencies.\n",

    "author": "Rebeca Moen",
    "content": "\tWormhole, a preeminent player in blockchain interoperability, has announced a significant step towards decentralization with the introduction of its native token, W, and an accompanying airdrop. This move underscores Wormhole's commitment to fostering an open and decentralized internet, which is the bedrock of the Web3 ethos.\n\tThe recently released W token, intrinsic to Wormhole's suite of protocols, marks a pivotal moment in the platform's journey. Wormhole has achieved widespread adoption, supporting over 200 applications and enabling more than a million unique wallets to conduct cross-chain transactions across 30+ blockchains. The introduction of W is set to enhance this multichain functionality further.\n\tTokenomics and Strategic Airdrop\n\tWormhole’s tokenomics reveal a strategic allocation designed to reinforce the platform's stability and longevity. Out of the 10 billion W tokens minted, 1.8 billion will initially circulate across five blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana. The distribution aligns with the platform's decentralization ethos, with 82% of the tokens locked and scheduled for gradual release over a four-year period.\n\tThe airdrop targets various Wormhole network participants, with 617 million W tokens dedicated to community and launch efforts. Eligibility was determined based on users' interactions with the Wormhole ecosystem, with a snapshot capturing on-chain activities before February 6, 2024.\n\tGovernance and Community Empowerment\n\tIn alignment with progressive decentralization, W token holders will soon exercise governance rights within the Wormhole ecosystem. Token-based governance will allow the community to steer the protocol's trajectory, fostering a more autonomous and participatory ecosystem.\n\tWormhole's governance model emphasizes transparency and inclusivity, with the initial focus on treasury management and community programs. This approach aligns with a broader trend in blockchain communities where token holders are entrusted with significant responsibilities to shape the platform's future.\n\tStaying Vigilant Against Scams\n\tWith the advent of the W airdrop, Wormhole has issued a safety notice to its users, advising caution against potential scams. The platform stresses the importance of verifying official sources and channels to avoid falling prey to malicious actors.\n\tConclusion\n\tWormhole's W token airdrop is not only a step towards distributing ownership and control within its ecosystem but also a testament to the protocol's success and ambition. As the platform continues to pave the way for a connected and decentralized future, the community's role becomes increasingly central, embodying the ideals of Web3.\n",

    "time": "2020-11-18",
    "author": "Brian Njuguna",
    "content": "\tIn the last one month, the top 10 decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum network have hit 1,017,760 daily active wallet users, according to data acquisition and analytics company DappRadar.\n\tMost Ethereum users are on DeFi platforms\n\tPer the report, 94% or 952,920 of the daily active wallets fall under the decentralized finance (DeFi) and exchange dapps category. This can be attributed to the fact that 6 of the top 10 are in this sector, while two belong to the high-risk category, which are dapps that don't last for more than a few months. The remaining two are from the marketplace and gaming categories.\n\tCompared to the mobile app market, the one million users is relatively small, but it shows a notable turning point that DeFi has made the Ethereum network a force to be reckoned with.\n\tThis report correlates with the fact that Ethereum has been making headways in recent months because its blockchain is being heavily leveraged in the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, as well as for other projects like dapps and smart contracts.\n\tFor instance, $100 million worth of Tether (USDT), a leading stablecoin, was recently transferred from the Tron network, a blockchain-based decentralized operating system, to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\tThe report noted:\n\t\"Crypto.com, Compound, and Uniswap lead the charge accounting for 90% of the daily active wallets. Crypto.com is pulling out ahead with almost half a million daily active wallets in the last 30 days.\"\n\tCollectibles and gaming take a share\n\tNot only is the Ethereum blockchain being embraced in the DeFi market, but it also plays a huge part in the digital collectible and gaming sectors. This can be alluded to because Axie Infinity, a blockchain gaming dapp, and Rarible, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, made it to the top ten.\n\tThese statistics show that technological innovation is continuously taking place in this space. For instance, sports teams are leveraging the Ethereum network to enable fans to build their preferred teams and trade digital collectibles.\n\tEarlier this month, German football giant, FC Bayern Munich, joined an Ethereum-based fantasy soccer game platform called Sorare, which leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The reigning UEFA Champions League winners became the third German club playing under the Bundesliga league to join Sorare, which has at least 100 licensed teams.\n\tIn other news, Ethereum stored on crypto exchanges recently sank to a two-year low, and this was interpreted to mean that the confidence of holders was growing based on the long term value of this cryptocurrency.\n",

    "author": "Nicholas Otieno",
    "content": "\tThe Provenance Blockchain Foundation, a San Francisco based public blockchain network designed and developed to support financial service industry needs, on Monday announced the appointment of Morgan McKenney as the company’s CEO.\n\tIn her role, McKenney is tasked with spearheading growth and adoption of the Provenance Blockchain through enabling the firm to partner with various financial institutions, fintechs, developers, and industry players to realize significant business benefits from blockchain.\n\tMcKenney brings broad experience to this role. The executive spent almost twenty years at CitiGroup in various senior executive operating roles worldwide. In the past, McKenney led big payments businesses in the institutional industry globally in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. She promoted partnerships with governments, corporates, and banks to help them operate their business and enable real-time commerce. She also managed Citi’s innovation lab in Singapore and successfully implemented two blockchain projects with NASDAQ and Alibaba and Ant Financial.\n\tMcKenney recently served as the Chief Operating Officer for Global Consumer Banking, Citi’s Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Also, most recently, McKenney served as Special Advisor at Centre. This consortium promotes trusted use of fiat-backed stablecoins and as a Bain Expert Advisor in the digital assets space.\n\tMcKenney has therefore demonstrated a track of work that uniquely positions her to lead the Provenance Blockchain Foundation, a rapidly growing blockchain that is increasingly relied upon by financial institutions.\n\tMcKenney talked about her appointment and said: “The Provenance Blockchain has successfully demonstrated the ability to deliver material business benefits to participating financial institutions and their customers at scale. I am excited to advance the work underway and to deepen the innovation ecosystem of financial institutions, fintechs, developers, and other industry leaders building on and leveraging Provenance Blockchain to make financial services significantly more efficient, with more real-time capabilities and reduced counterparty risk.”\n\tTransforming the Financial Services Industry\n\tBlockchain technology is considered most attractive to financial businesses because it solves several problems plaguing the industry today, namely efficiency and security.\n\tLaunched in 2018, The Provenance Blockchain Foundation continues bringing greater transparency and liquidity to digital transactions worldwide. The blockchain firm helps to revolutionize how financial institutions access, trade, and issue assets globally.\n\tIn May last year, The Provenance Blockchain Foundation launched a public, open-source, permissionless, decentralized, proof-of-stake blockchain that provides financial service companies with a ledger, registry, and exchange across multiple financial assets and markets.\n\tThe open-source blockchain reduces the need for third-party intermediation. Therefore it is significantly lowering costs and freeing up capital in financial transactions. Furthermore, the Provenance blockchain promotes greater transparency and liquidity and allows for new financial engineering and business opportunities. This decentralized ecosystem also enables a robust validator/staking framework and real-time settlement and market-driven pricing.\n\tMany financial firms such as asset managers and banks are onboarding the Provenance blockchain in verticals like loan origination, banking and payments, financing and trading, and securities exchanges.\n\tThe Provenance Blockchain Foundation also provides grants to developers to accelerate growth in the DeFi ecosystem.\n",

    "content": "\tVisa applied for a new patent application to create a blockchain-based digital currency on a centralized computer, according to a publication by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\tThe patent was originally filed in November 2019, and was described as “Digital Fiat Currency.” The US dollar was mentioned as one of the fiat currencies to be used potentially, although the patent could also apply to other central bank digital currencies including the pound, yen, and the euro.\n\tFiled by Simon J. Hurry and Alexander Pierre with the Visa International Service Association, the application noted that Ethereum could be used as a possible network for the digital currency.\n\tThe central entity computer described in the patent will receive requests with details including the serial number and the denomination of physical currency. Blockchain will be recording the creation of the digital currency and the removal of the physical currency from circulation in a fiat currency system.\n\tFormer Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Christopher Giancarlo commented on Visa’s digital currency patent this week during the virtual conference Consensus Distributed, “This confirms when the US does big things like the space program and the internet, there are partnerships between the private and public sector. This patent filing is evidence the private sector is very much at work on the future of money.”\n\tAlso known as “Crypto Dad,” Giancarlo has previously revealed his vision for a “true digital dollar.” He has adopted a new role as co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project, a partnership between Accenture and the Digital Dollar Foundation to explore a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\tVisa issues Binance Card\n\tLeading crypto exchange Binance announced the launch of its new product 'Binance Card' which aims to provide crypto payment services anywhere in the world.

    "time": "2024-01-23",
    "author": "Jessie A Ellis",
    "content": "\tCongresswoman Maxine Waters, the Ranking Member of the United States House Financial Services Committee, questions Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook) regarding its trademark applications indicative of a potential expansion in the digital assets ecosystem.\n\tWaters' concerns, conveyed in a letter dated January 22, 2024, to Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Javier Olivan, stem from five trademark applications filed by Meta on March 18, 2022. Despite Meta's assertion on October 12, 2023, that the company was not engaging in any digital assets work, these applications suggest otherwise. The committee is pressing Meta for clarity on any ongoing or planned blockchain or crypto-related projects.\n\tThe trademark applications cover a range of services in the crypto and blockchain sphere, including trading, exchange, payments, transfers, and the associated hardware and software infrastructure. A Notice of Allowance (NOA) for each filing indicates Meta's applications meet registration requirements. Meta must now file a statement of use or request an extension within six months of the NOA issuance dates, which range from August 2023 to January 2024.\n\tThis inquiry isn't Maxine Waters' first involvement in scrutinizing tech giants' forays into the digital assets sector. In 2019, Waters was vocal in her concerns over Meta’s Libra (later Diem) stablecoin project. Meta had announced its plans to develop the cryptocurrency and a corresponding digital wallet, Calibra. However, the project faced significant backlash from lawmakers and regulators, leading to its eventual discontinuation and the sale of its assets to Silvergate Bank in January 2022.\n\tWaters' letter questions the extent of Meta's involvement in digital assets, including any plans to launch a crypto payments platform, the company's research into stablecoins, partnerships with stablecoin projects, and the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The congresswoman is particularly concerned about the implications of big tech companies like Meta entering the digital assets space, given their access to vast amounts of user data and the lack of a federal framework for regulating such ventures.\n\tIn the broader context, Meta's involvement in digital assets reflects a growing trend among tech giants exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency as potential new business avenues. However, this expansion raises critical questions about user privacy, data security, regulatory compliance, and the impact on traditional financial systems.\n",

    "content": "\tBlockchain technology has been a game-changer, fueling the rise of decentralized applications and introducing novel concepts like Web3, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Leading this significant transition is BNB Chain, a platform dedicated to creating cross-chain/multi-chain infrastructure and interoperability. They aim to lay the groundwork for the next 1 billion Web3 users, making it effortless for Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Metaverse dApps to scale.\n\tIn our exclusive interview today with Walter Lee, Web3 Gaming Growth Lead in BNB Chain Innovation, we delve deeper into the strategies BNB Chain is employing to reach this ambitious target, their plans to bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and traditional users, their approach to keeping transaction fees affordable, and a sneak peek into some upcoming updates and features. We also touch upon BNB Chain's competitiveness in the rapidly evolving blockchain space and their unyielding support for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Keep reading to discover their innovative strategies, upcoming developments, and insights on the future of Web3.\n\tBNB Chain aims to reach 1 billion users. What strategies are in place to achieve this ambitious goal?\n\tBNB Chain provides cross-chain/multi-chain infrastructure and interoperability to lay the foundation for the next 1 billion Web3 users making it super easy for Web3 Gaming, NFTs and Metaverse dApps to scale.\n\tTo accommodate a large number of users, BNB Chain will improve performance and scalability. In addition to its storage network BNB Greenfield, it has optimized its infrastructure by implementing layer 2 solutions including opBNB into BNB Chain’s modular stack. Its EVM-compatibility means that it will be a value-add to the network and handle increased transaction volume and user demand\n\tPerformance improvements including its Layer 2 solutions such as opBNB is able to hit around 4K TPS. Also, it has an estimated 90% reduction in gas fees at $0.005. This creates a responsive and low latency environment for users.The gaming industry is huge and growing at a rapid pace, there are an estimated 3 billion gamers out there and there has been a lot of growth for web3 gaming on BNB Chain in recent times. Hence, we believe that Gaming will be one of the key verticals for BNB Chain to achieve 1 billion users!\n\tHow does BNB Chain plan to bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and users who still rely on consistent, centralized relationships and identities?\n\tWeb3 technology is not exactly a revolution for existing industries, it is in fact a market expansion. BNB Chain understands that existing users cannot be disrupted instantly. There has been observable maturity in the development growth in the web3 space to bridge this gap, starting from the user journey. For most dApps, there has been a move away from “forcing” users to connect to a blockchain wallet. Instead, dApps could leverage social logins to generate wallets attached to the social identity and assets would be automatically dropped into the linked wallet. Users would then be empowered to make their own decisions in terms of managing the owned assets.\n\tFor developers, BNB Chain’s goal is to provide the best and most extensive infrastructure for true web3 developments. For example, BNB Greenfield, which is a decentralized storage platform designed to revolutionize the data economy by utilizing the power of decentralized technology for data ownership and management. Built within the BNB Chain ecosystem, this platform introduces a decentralized approach to data management that seamlessly integrates with BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\tFeatures include:\n\tCompared to other decentralized storage services like IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, and Web3.storage, Greenfield offers several advantages. It is designed to be highly scalable, cloud-native, and compatible with both Web2 and Web3 standards. It provides strong performance and reliability regardless of the amount of data being stored. The integration with BSC and the EVM environment allows for fully programmable capabilities and a wide range of use cases.\n\tOverall, the web3 industry is still very young so there will be continued innovations that will aid users and developers in adding benefits and features to various industries such as in Finance and Gaming.\n\tCan you tell us about BNB Chain’s transaction fees, and what measures are in place to keep them affordable for users?\n\tBNB Chain’s transaction fees have been one of the lowest in the industry, starting off at around 5 gwei. In recent times, BNB Chain’s validators have opted towards reducing that further in order to encourage competitiveness, which will result in positive ecosystem growth. As of April 2023, BNB Chain’s gas fees have further reduced to 3 gwei, and that is around a few cents per transaction.\n\tOn top of that, BNB Chain has recently launched the testnet for opBNB, which will further reduce the gas fees by around 90% to $0.005! This should be very exciting for both developers and users, opBNB is expected to launch into the mainnet in Q3 this year.\n\tCan you discuss any upcoming updates or features that users can look forward to on BNB Chain?\n\topBNB – The opBNB Testnet is live and we are calling on testnet Validators and dApp Builders to try the Testnet and provide feedback.\n\topBNB represents our commitment to ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for users, developers, and projects on BSC. This development is part of our ongoing mission to bring the power of blockchain to everyone while embracing and driving forward innovation.\n\topBNB is BSC's answer to the scalability challenge that has limited the mass adoption of blockchain technology. As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer 2 chain, opBNB solution is based on Optimism OP Stack to further enhance BSC scalability while preserving affordability and security.\n\tOptimistic Rollups was proposed to reduce the computational load on the main chain by executing transactions off-chain and only posting transaction data on-chain as calldata. This approach drastically improves scalability by bundling multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main chain.\n\tThe mix of BSC's strong ability and opBNB's dedicated new features, which includes making data access easier, improving the cache system, and adjusting the submission process algorithm to allow simultaneous operations (also known as batcher), allows OpBNB to push the gas limit up to a whopping 100M. This is a big jump from Optimism's 30M (source: link). Thanks to these new features, OpBNB can handle over 4000 transfer transactions each second and keep the average cost of a transaction below 0.005 USD. By harnessing the power of Optimistic Rollups, opBNB moves computation and state storage off-chain, alleviating congestion and driving down transaction costs.\n\tBNB Greenfield – The BNB Greenfield testnet is live and the community is calling on testnet Validators, Storage providers (SPs), and dApp Builders to join the decentralized storage tech stack to shape the future of data ownership in Web3.\n\tBNB Greenfield is an innovative blockchain and storage platform that seeks to unleash the power of decentralized technology on data ownership and the data economy. It is a decentralized, open-source storage chain with BNB as its token.\n\tWith a focus on facilitating decentralized data management and access, Greenfield aims to revolutionize the data economy by easing the storing and management of data and linking data ownership with the DeFi context of BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\tWhat sets Greenfield apart from existing centralized and decentralized storage systems are its three key components:\n\tHackvolution – BNB Chain are inviting all developers, researchers and scientists to participate in the online Hackvolution event that seeks to redefine and empower the next-generation of dApps with the potential of opBNB and BNB Greenfield.\n\tWhether you are interested in Infrastructure, DeFi, Gaming, or AI, this hackathon provides the platform to explore, innovate, and make a lasting impact. This is your chance to demonstrate your creativity, technical skills, and entrepreneurial spirit as you work alongside a vibrant community of like-minded individuals.\n\tThe hackathon is supported by industry leaders such as COMBO, CyberConnect, Hooked Protocol, Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud and Ultiverse. Generous rewards, including cash prizes, marketing packages, participation in the BNB Chain’s Gas Grant program, and discounted access to essential tools and services, are up for grabs.\n\tIt’s an exciting chance for dvelopers to gain recognition, network with industry experts, and propel their project to new heights.\n\tHow does BNB Chain plan to stay competitive as the blockchain space continues to evolve and new players enter the market?\n\tBNB Chain is one of the most up to date and extensive infrastructure technology. A good example would be the launches of zkBNB and opBNB, as well as the fully decentralized storage layer, Greenfield. With an extensive infrastructure, developers and users get to build and experience Web3 in the best ways possible, building the strongest advantage of BNB Chain our large and fast growing community.\n\tBNB Chain has more than 3 million in our social communities, and over 1500 dApps. This vibrant range of products and community size are the key contributions for over 1 million daily active on-chain users in this current market.\n\tAs “BNB” actually means “Build N Build”, we believe by continuously building with developers and community through support provision and engagements respectively, BNB Chain will continue to be a dominant ecosystem in the web3 industry.\n\tHow does BNB Chain support the development of decentralized applications (dApps)?\n\tBNB Chain recognizes the importance of the community and hence, we have been constantly engaging developers and users. We understand that developers are our pillars for growth, and there are many challenges in developing Web3 products, so BNB Chain has been providing various supports including but not limited to:\n\tThere's no doubt that BNB Chain is making significant strides in propelling the mass adoption of blockchain technology, particularly in the realms of Web3, NFTs, and Metaverse. The platform's cutting-edge features such as opBNB, BNB Greenfield, and upcoming initiatives like Hackvolution, promise to revolutionize not just the world of blockchain but the larger digital ecosystem as well.\n\tBNB Chain's commitment to remaining agile in the ever-changing tech industry, their comprehensive support to developers, and their dedication to building a robust, active, and vibrant community all testify to their potential for continued growth and success. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, we look forward to seeing more innovative developments from BNB Chain and its dedicated team.\n",

    "content": "\tEl Salvador is planning to issue its first bitcoin bond next month, the Central American country's Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya announced.\n\tZelaya elaborated that El Salvador is working to have the bond \"totally ready\" for issuance between March 15 and March 20 as a means to strengthen the country's economy.\n\t“If we really want to build this country, we have to invest in it like this,” Zelaya said speaking at a local news program.\n\tFurthermore, Zelaya said that the government is still planning to issue $1 billion for the first bond, as previously mentioned on November 20. However, Zelaya also mentioned that there are chances of oversubscription for the bond by about $500 million minimum.\n\tBuyers are expected to have easier access to the bond than traditional ones. It will allow a minimum purchase of $100 and does not require a stockbroker to conduct the transactions.\n\tThe bond will be issued on Blockstream’s Liquid Network sidechain and they “will comply with all the regulations of the financial markets,” such as know-your-customer (KYC) and due diligence practices.\n\tThe bitcoin bond idea was first introduced at an event on November 20, by El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele and Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow.\n\tFitch downgrades El Salvador into \"Junk\" level\n\tHowever, Fitch Ratings - a top American credit rating agency - has downgraded El Salvador's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'CCC' from 'B-', citing risks from its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender last year, according to Bloomberg.\n\tIn a report, Fitch Ratings stated that the downgrade shows the country's critical increase in financing risks that have risen from increased reliance on short-term debt.\n\t\"weakening of institutions and concentration of power in the presidency has increased policy unpredictability, and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender has added uncertainty about the potential for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program that would unlock financing for 2022-2023.\"\n\tAlthough crypto enthusiasts have been keen on bitcoin bonds, several financial experts have argued on the fact that whether they are a good investment.\n\tThe IMF recently noted that some of its directors “expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds.”\n\tAccording to January 26, 2022, a report by Blokchain.News, the IMF expressed concern about risks related to El Salvador’s issuance of bitcoin-backed bonds. It urged El Salvador to terminate bitcoin as legal tender as soon as possible due to the high price volatility of the digital currency being a major risk.\n\tEl Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender since June 2021, with 62 votes approval out of 84 through its parliament. In September, Bitcoin officially was circulated in this country as legal tender.\n",

Equities also lost some steam as a report casted doubt on Moderna's vaccine. In the alt space, we saw Tezos, Cardano and Link up more than 5% in the past 24 hours. It was also the second day ETH broke to the upside from its enormous wedge. While ETH hasn't really decisively rallied despite closing above this gigantic wedge for the second day, it is already up 66% while BTC has only risen 37% this year. I'll be looking to pile my bet on ETH should BTC starts rallying given it's relatively high beta. BTC's open interest is holding steady while volume for the past few sessions has been slightly lower than last two week's average that it feels to me we are likely to head into somewhat of a short-term inflexion point where we make a decisive break to the up or downside. Just look at the doji candlestick closed yesterday, so here's how I think what can pan out over the next few days:\n\tThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect the view of Blockchain.News.\n",

If you like the article, please follow us here on Blockchain.News so you won't miss our future publications.\n\tWhat a volatile Sunday for Bitcoin as it plunged from $9,800 to $8,100 in a single hour, a very large outsized move for a weekend trading session that even Coinbase suffered an outage. There was no news/catalyst, instead, I think it was a planned outsized sale that happened. A likely scenario is that coordinated selling or take-profit via OTC and exchanges. Despite $275 mln of BTC sell liquidations in the last 24 hours and around 10% of futures open interest declined across the board, open interest is still hovering $3bn and about 50% more than post-black Thursday's crash in March. That says to me that there are just more longer-term investors sticking around. Predicting the price of Bitcoin post its halving isn't going to be easy. If I have to make a guess, I would expect it to retrace some of its gains in the short-term. It depends on the momentum of Bitcoin's price heading into halving. If the price continues to stay firm and head above 9,000, I would expect it to see a retracement albeit a less horrifying one compared to March 12. Even if BTC does continue to slide into $8k, I still think there is some likelihood of selling (i.e. miner captiluation) Why? Firstly, there have been quite a few funds, traders and market-makers who have positioned long, albeit less after yesterday. Secondly, miners selling into halving as the smaller players cant stay profitable. Trade strategy? I've been advocating to go Long Volatility in the last two weeks and that should play out quite well, I would start taking profit in 50% of them right now since implied volatility has now spiked higher. I also shared last Thursday to build put positions if BTC crosses 10k, that would have worked out quite nicely if you've bought some too. For spot, I am a buyer between $7,800 to $8,000, and if I own some BTC, seller between $9,300 to $9,500.

    "content": "\tThe novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19 has spread to at least 25 other countries and caused 5 deaths outside of mainland China. Restrictions in Hubei, of the epicenter province of the outbreak, have been imposed further on its citizens. In Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus originated, has been banning its citizens from leaving their homes.\n\tThe World Health Organization announced that the future path of the epidemic is “impossible to predict.”\n\tChina has also started disinfecting and isolating used banknotes, aiming to stop the spread of the coronavirus. By using ultraviolet light and high temperatures to disinfect bills, banknotes are sealed and stored for around 14 days before recirculating them to the public. The nation’s central bank made an emergency issuance of the four-billion-yuan worth of new bills for the province of Hubei prior to the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\tThe birth of a CoronaCoin\n\tAmid the climbing death toll in China due to the coronavirus, the cryptocurrency community has seen the emergence of a new coin–a coronavirus-backed token.\n\tPublished first on Reddit, the primary purpose of the token is to spread awareness of the health issue across the board. The CoronaCoin (NCOV), will be an ERC-20 token, and the total supply of the token is based on the world population. With one NCOV token per each person alive globally (7,604,953,650), the token is burnt every 48 hours, according to the number of infections and casualties from the virus.\n\tControversy over the CoronaCoin\n\tThe cryptocurrency community on Reddit also commented on the creation of the token. The community has skewed toward the end of the skeptical spectrum regarding the features of the coin, as the post indicates that investors would be able to benefit from the spread of the virus. A user on Reddit called the token a “shitcoin,” and deducted that “it must be a bull market” as this token made an appearance. Another user had the opinion that the token would “do the opposite” of incentivizing people to spread the disease for the token to gain value.\n\tThe token’s website states that a portion of the funds will be donated to Red Cross for “nCov relief,” however, it does not state the precise portion. The crypto community also suggested that Bitcoin would remove the need to quarantine cash.\n\tRed Cross: The issues with donations and how blockchain can help\n\tThere has been concern that the millions of dollars being donated for the public, as well as the protective equipment, are not being put to use where needed, and it has been reported that the equipment has been misdirected.\n\tBeijing has ordered all public donations for the coronavirus outbreak to be funneled to five government-backed charity organizations, which automatically assumes that these government-backed charities are all fit for purpose, and would be able to manage in a centralized manner of the recent outbreak.\n\tBlockchain.News previously reported that the Red Cross in China has previously mishandled billions of dollars donated for the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan province in Western China in 2008. The Red Cross in China reflected, “One of the lessons learned was that emergency response must be better developed at the local level.”\n\tAccording to Syren Johnstone, the Executive Director of the Master of Law (Compliance and Regulation) Program at the University of Hong Kong, a private blockchain network would “enable the recording and tracking of anything that is donated, from donation dollars to N95 masks.” By holding the person or organization accountable, donations for delivery could be tracked from the donor all the way to its final-use. Blockchain would also enable transparency for the general public to understand how their donations have been used and its progress. While a private blockchain is strictly controlled, it can also allow for public transparency for donors and donees, as well as authorities.\n",

    "content": "\tA Texas resident named Joshua Thomas Argires has been charged by US authorities for using funds from a COVID-19 relief program to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\tThe criminal charge was announced by Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Argires was taken into custody for fraudulently securing more than $1.1 million in a Payment Protection Program (PPP) which he invested in a cryptocurrency account.\n\tViolation of the CARES Act is a Crime\n\tThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a Federal law enacted on March 29. It was enacted to help Small Business Administrators (SBA) to access emergency financial assistance to combat the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One major source of relief the CARES Act provides is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding. These funds were approved to be digitally distributed to qualifying small businesses back in April.\n\tJoshua Argires is one of many US citizens that has been charged in recent times based on violations of the CARES Act. He claimed the funds through the companies Texas Barbecue and Houston Landscaping. According to the statement issued:\n\t“Neither Texas Barbecue nor Houston Landscaping has employees or pays wages consistent with the amounts claimed in the PPP loan applications. The complaint further asserts that both of these loans were funded, but that none of the funds were used for payroll or other expenses authorized under the PPP. Rather, the funds received on behalf of Texas Barbecue were invested in a cryptocurrency account, while the funds obtained for Houston Landscaping were held in a bank account and slowly depleted via ATM withdrawals, according to the charges.”\n\tFollowing these questionable allegations, Argires made his first appearance before the US Magistrate Judge Peter Bray on Monday.\n\tBlockchain Firms Also Benefited From COVID-19 Relief Funds\n\tBesides the role that blockchain technology is playing to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, blockchain inventions were also considered as a potential channel for the disbursement of the funds. In addition to these, blockchain firms (particularly Tron) also benefited from the US government COVID-19 relief funds as it was awarded $2 million.\n",

According to cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko, the trading volume of DYDX reached $1,217,300,925 within 24 hours, surpassing Coinbase’s spot market for the first time.\n\tThe token of Defi exchange dYdX also hit a record high of 21.80 today, rising by nearly 50% in 24 hours.\n\tAccording to Coinmarketcap data, DYDX’s 24-hour trading volume increased by 196.28%. At the time of writing, dydx is trading at $21.43.\n\tIn yesterday’s Twitter, WuBlockchain Chinese cryptocurrency reporter Colin Wu pointed out that the demand of Chinese users for decentralized exchanges and other DeFi products has surged recently. He explained:\n\t\"A large number of Chinese users will flood into the DeFi world, and the number of users of MetaMask and dYdX will greatly increase. All Chinese communities are discussing how to learn defi.\"\n\tAs Chinese investors are worried about the stricter regulatory measures of the Chinese government, such as an announcement issued by the Central Bank of China last Friday mentioned that all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal.\n\tVirtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and other virtual currencies do not enjoy the same legal status as legal tender, are not legally repayable, thus should not be traded as circulating currencies in the market, which has caused investors’ FUD anxiety.\n\tInvestors have moved from centralized exchanges such as Huobi to decentralized exchanges dYdX and FutureSwap for continuing cryptocurrency leveraged trading.\n\tAs reported by Blockchain.News today, Huobi Global, one of the world’s largest digital currency trading platforms, has announced it will gradually unwind its services in mainland China as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and other state regulators seek to intensify their clampdown on all activities bordering digital currencies in the country.\n\tHuobi officials stated that it has stopped using mobile phone numbers from mainland China in new account registrations and will phase out existing accounts in mainland China before the end of the year “to comply with local laws and regulations.”\n\tHuobi token has fallen by 42.61% in 7 days and is valued at around $7.63, according to the current price.\n",

While essentially giving Paxos the green light, the SEC’s letter also clearly stipulated that at this stage, “No more than seven (7) participants will be eligible to use the Paxos Settlement Service for clearance and settlement and the participants will be required to satisfy the criteria for participation.”\n\tEuropean banks Credit Suisse and Société Générale will be among the first to use the Paxos Settlement Service and will also be among the first to settle U.S. equities outside of the legacy infrastructure for the first time in 50 years. The innovative blockchain product will remove intermediaries and allow two parties to bilaterally settle securities trades directly with each other which will significantly reduce transaction fees and give permissioned-users access to capital that would historically be trapped in the legacy systems.\n\tTaking the First Step\n\tAccording to Charles Cascarilla, CEO and Co-Founder, Paxos, the U.S. equities business is facing unprecedented consolidation and economic pressure which requires comprehensive changes to the legacy structures. He sees the Paxos Settlement Service as an important first step in reimagining the post-trade structure.\n\tHe concluded the press release stating, Cascarilla added, \"We look forward to working with our early adopter partners to further develop the ecosystem. Together, we'll create financial benefits and achieve operational efficiencies with blockchain technology that will facilitate an open financial system. We're starting with U.S. listed equities, but this technology can be scale to many asset classes across geographies and for all types of clients.\"\n",

    "content": "\tJeremy Allaire, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Circle, a US-based peer-to-peer payments company, has sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department calling for an improved regulation that can offer a “meaningful safe harbor” for players within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\tAllaire’s letter was inspired by the recent news that the outgoing Donald Trump’s administration through the Treasury Department is planning to enact a regulatory ban over self-hosted crypto wallets.\n\tIn his letter, Jeremy recanted his experience at the beginning of the internet boom decades ago noting that he correctly predicted that the then-emerging technology will take over open communications networks despite the imminent fears of risks that prevailed at the time. Jeremy noted that the events of 1996 are seemingly playing out with open-source blockchain networks of today, a move the government is planning to clamp down on.\n\tHe also noted that the innovations of public blockchains are currently been used around the world to service clients across various industries and that any attempt to bring in strict regulations will give China an upper hand in the race for supremacy in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems.\n\tAllaire noted that the industry is working assiduously to prevent the technology from been harnessed by bad actors, which is one of the basic and biggest fears of the Treasury Department. Per the Circle CEO's words:\n\t“We have focused much of our effort on the safe and secure delivery of our technology to our growing list of clients across multiple industries. The promise of public blockchains is based in part on the security of our technology. Our industry is intensely focused on addressing concerns about the potential for financial crimes that exist with blockchain transactions and I am equally sensitive to the Treasury’s focus on the same.”\n\tThe CEO then suggested that the Treasury Department should give the industry players about a year or two to implement technologies that can help in ensuring compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and other transaction-reporting requirements, a move that will not hinder the innovations currently available in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\tJeremy Allaire's proposal echoes some US lawmakers who have also expressed concerns over the proposed legislation as reported by Blockchain.news.\n",

    "content": "\tBlockchain data platform Chainalysis published a report Wednesday, indicating China remains one of the largest cryptocurrency markets worldwide.\n\tPer the report, addresses estimated to be controlled by users in China for the first six months this year have received over $150 million worth of crypto, around one-third, compared to the U.S that China comes second behind the U.S. China remains one of the largest markets and is active in cryptocurrency worldwide.\n\tChinese crackdown against Bitcoin mining\n\tOver 90% of Bitcoin mining capacity was lost since massive bitcoin mining sites were forced to shut down in June.\n\tOn-chain data reflects the bitcoin mining pools weekly volume dropped to under 5000 BTC from around 10,000 since mid-May, right after China’s crackdown against domestic bitcoin mining activities. Figures over the past six months also indicate that most China-based have been hit by Chinese authorities, including AntPool, Poolin, BTC.top and F2Pool.\n\tThe government consider ultra-rich people like early Bitcoin miners and people advocating for liberty or self-sovereignty to be “dissidents of the natural inclination.” The report citing the expert explains that preventing capital flight and stopping illegal money services businesses from operating is the primary goal of the Chinese government to maintain social stability and unity.\n\tThe Digital yuan is unlikely to impact the dollar status in the short term\n\tMeanwhile, the promotion of digital yuan, one kind of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in China, brings a monetary reform of fiat money worldwide and intensifies diplomatic tension, especially Sino-US relations. The report believes China aims to set various goals, including conducting \"data-driven improvements to monetary policy and heightened surveillance of citizens’ financial activity\". Internationally, China appears to get rid of the U.S.’s regime sanctions in the short term.\n\tAdjunct Senior Fellow of the Centre for a New American Security Yaya Fanusie convinces digital yuan is unlikely to threaten the U.S. dollar in the short term. Still, digital yuan and CBDCs could falter the dominant status of the dollar in the financial system in the long run. “They will try to make arrangements with other countries where they enable CBDC to CBDC exchange. Think of it as an atomic swap of CBDCs….These transactions would not rely on the SWIFT system. If they become the norm, there would be less need for people outside of the U.S. to hold U.S. dollars,” Fanusie added.\n\tConcerns crypto crimes in China\n\tMore than 1100 suspects were arrested in June related to committing Crypto-related crimes in China. The report concerns the crypto-related crime committed in China. Chinese addresses have been sent over $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency to addresses associated with illicit activity such as scams and darknet market operations and received over $2.0 billion.\n",

Not every bank is willing to step into the crypto world, and I think it says a lot about how progressive that bank is trying to be,” Holmes noted.\n\tThe partnership is a blow to Ripple, the crypto payments network, whose longstanding relationship with MoneyGram ended after the US SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, stating that the company violated federal securities laws.\n\tHolmes stated that the collaboration with Stellar is completely a different relationship from the partnership that MoneyGram had with Ripple. Leaving out the question of whether Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP is a security or not in the perspective of law, he said that the vision that MoneyGram and Ripple were working on had certain limitations.\n\tHolmes revealed the challenges that Moneygram faced during its partnership with Ripple. He identified the first challenge involved MoneyGram trying to create an FX market in a different world, and it really required a lot more time to bring that to life and make it work. Holmes mentioned the other challenge – MoneyGram was trading XRP, which, unfortunately, became so volatile because of the legal issues facing the parent company Ripple Labs.\n\tRipple’s SEC Lawsuit Impacting Crypto Sector\n\tThe bad blood between the US SEC and Ripple started in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit claiming that Ripple Labs had violated securities laws by failing to register its XRP cryptocurrency as a security.\n\tDuring that time, Ripple used its XRP cryptocurrency as a vehicle to finance its core business of seamless cross-border transactions for financial institutions and had been doing so for seven years since it created the cryptocurrency in 2013.\n\tThe lawsuit has adversely affected Ripple and created more confusion to the already complex regulatory discussions over whether crypto-assets should be regarded as commodities or securities or something else.\n\tIf cryptocurrencies are securities, as defined by court precedent, then they must be regulated and approved by the SEC, which demands disclosures from various crypto firms.\n\tHowever, Ripple maintains that XRP is not a security and therefore does not need approval from the SEC. Ripple also argued that the SEC currently allows other crypto tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin to be traded like commodities and therefore not required to register as security.\n\tHowever, the SEC argues that RiRipple’sase is different because the firm has been actively using XRP to fund its core business and essentially represents an investment in the company itself. The regulator, therefore, considers XRP as security and not a commodity and therefore falls under the SESEC’surisdiction under court precedent known as the Howey Test.\n",

    "content": "\tOver 70% of Argentines see cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin as the most effective way to hedge against inflation and store financial value, according to Paxful research.\n\tThe global peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, Paxful recently released a survey on the potential of crypto in Argentina focused on investor sentiment and habits and found a vast majority saw crypto and Bitcoin as a way to protect their finances.\n\tAccording to the Paxful Argentina survey on Aug 28, the majority of participants, 73.4% to be exact, believe that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are the most effective way to protect their funds in the current economic scenario which has been greatly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\tEconomic Shelter\n\tPaxful’s data was obtained through an online survey and the sample consisted of 1113 respondents, aged 18 to over 55, with a predominance of the male gender. The findings show that Argentines welcome new forms of investment like Bitcoin to protect their financial savings due to the economic crisis.\n\tMagdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America Manager said:\n\t“During this year we have observed a major increase in the operations carried out by Argentine users on our platform, especially since the pandemic started, registering an increase of 37.5% in the volume compared to the previous periods.”\n\tFrom the respondents, just under 70% reported that they had invested in cryptocurrency at least once with 42.7% citing their most common reason as being to provide economic shelter against inflation.\n\tThe findings show that for most to the respondents, cryptocurrency has allowed these citizens to remain safe from the rising inflation and close almost 70% believe Bitcoin and crypto to be an extremely safe investment.\n\tAs it specifically pertains to Bitcoin, the survey participants who have invested reported that they did so for three major reasons—53% invested through an evaluation of Bitcoin’s global potential; 50.6% for its decentralized protocol; and, 49.1 % for its ability to act as a safe haven against government monetary policy and centralized banking systems.\n\tLearning Curve\n\tAmong the respondents to Paxful Argentina’s survey, the major reasons for those who had not invested in crypto at all (30.5%) in majority said it was due to a low understanding of digital currency and Bitcoin (24.2%)—indicating that there is still a learning curve for Argentina’s citizens.\n\tMagdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America Manager said:\n\t“We know that the crypto industry offers many opportunities that people still don’t know about. At Paxful we are working to educate citizens and show them that there is a new alternative to invest their money, which gives them financial freedom.”\n\tRussians Use Bitcoin to Escape Banks\n\tFinancial freedom from monolithic banking systems via cryptocurrency has been a common theme in recent studies.\n\tAnother recent study by Paxful peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace at the end of July, released some important data regarding the use of its p2p trading platform in Russia.\n\tFor several years, Russian lawmakers have been contemplating whether to legalize or ban cryptocurrencies. As a result, they created an atmosphere that has left the entire crypto industry in the nation in an uncertain state. Despite these hindrances, Russian users joining Paxful cryptocurrency exchange have risen by 350% over the last 12 months.\n\tAnton Kozlov, Paxful’s manager from the Russian market, said that:\n\t“Crisis aside, Russia has always had a monolithic banking system that is dominated by a few players, and the sentiment we get is that Russians are increasingly looking to find alternative ways to grow their earnings and participate in the financial markets.”\n",
