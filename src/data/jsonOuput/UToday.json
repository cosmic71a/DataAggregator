    "content": "\tThe Dogecoin community is enveloped in a somber mood as they bid farewell to Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became the face of the beloved \"Doge\" meme.\n\tThe news of Kabosu's passing was met with an outpouring of tributes, with Robinhood, a popular stock brokerage app, joining in to post a tribute to the canine icon.\n\tThe Robinhood official X account posted the message \"RIP 2005-2024\" to express condolences for the lovable canine that had captured the hearts of millions worldwide.\n\tRIP 2005-2024 üôè https://t.co/pdoNBYFYhc\n\tKabosu, who died at the age of 18, was not just a pet. Her quizzical expression captured in a photograph became a viral sensation, leading to the creation of countless memes and eventually inspiring the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Her image, synonymous with humor and positivity, brought joy to millions around the world and became a symbol of the playful spirit of the internet age.\n\tThe Dogecoin community, affectionately known as \"Shibes,\" also paid their respects to Kabosu, in noteworthy tributes. Social media platforms were flooded with messages of condolence, with many commenting that Kabosu's memory will live on.\n\t\n\t\n\tLikewise, Dogecoin's price saw a rise in value, a seeming show of respect for Kabosu. Dogecoin previously rose as high as 6% before partially losing some of its gains to trade up 1.6% in the last 24 hours to $0.165.\n\tReposting Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus alias Shibetoshi Nakamoto's eulogy on X, Robinhood reacted to Kabosu's death by posting \"RIP 2005-2024\" with a prayer emoticon. This message attracted the attention of Dogecoin community members who reacted to the post.\n\t\n\t\n\tRobinhood's acknowledgment of Kabosu's passing is significant, given the platform's role in facilitating Dogecoin trades that contributed to the cryptocurrency's mainstream popularity. The platform's tribute reflects the broader impact Kabosu had on the world of the internet and technology, transcending her origins as a meme to become a cultural icon.\n",

    "content": "\tRipple's Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has delivered an impressive one-minute explanation on tokenization that has stunned and enlightened the XRP community. His lucid explanation of how tokenization can enhance efficiency in asset management has stunned the XRP community.\n\t\"If someone can‚Äôt explain something in 60 seconds, they probably don‚Äôt understand it,\" Schwartz stated in Ripple's insightful clip series \"Crypto In One Minute,\" which explains a crypto concept within one minute.\n\tIn this particular clip, Schwartz explained how tokenization enhances efficiency within 60 seconds, proving that real understanding does not need a full minute.\n\tTokenization refers to the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This can include anything from real estate and art to stocks and intellectual property. In his talk, Schwartz discussed the potential of tokenization to reduce risks connected with asset ownership and transfer.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe XRP community's reaction to Schwartz's demystification of tokenization has been one of awe, with several commending his in-depth understanding of blockchain concepts and the speed of the delivery. The clarity and succinctness of his explanation seem to have resonated with the crypto community, as seen in the X comments.\n\tThe Ripple CTO's elucidation of tokenization has not only demystified a complex concept, but there is also a palpable sense of anticipation for the future. With the growing interest in tokenization, the XRP community is optimistic about the future and Ripple's potential to play a transformative role.\n\tIn February 2024, Zoniqx (previously Tassets), a pioneer in digital asset management, announced a collaboration with Ripple to streamline the tokenization process for real-world assets on XRPL.\n\tThis strategic collaboration harnesses the scalable infrastructure of XRP Ledger (XRPL) and integrates it with Zoniqx's Tokenization Platform as a Service (TPaaS) and Tokenization Life Cycle Management (TALM) solutions.\n\t\n\t\n\tAs Ripple continues to push the boundaries of blockchain technology, the crypto community stands ready to embrace the new possibilities that tokenization might bring to the table.\n",

    "content": "\tDogecoin (DOGE) has seen a noticeable decline in the activity of major players, or \"whales,\" coinciding with the recent passing of Kabosu, the dog immortalized in the iconic Doge meme. Analysis of key metrics shows a significant decline in whale activity.\n\tThus, according to IntoTheBlock, large transactions involving DOGE have dropped significantly over the past 24 hours, down 29.69% to 6.63 billion DOGE. Of particular note is the drop in transactions exceeding $100,000, from $1.56 billion to $1.12 billion, with 1,300 such transactions recorded during the period.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe decline in whale activity is also evidenced by a marked reduction in the inflow and outflow of funds to wallets containing at least 0.1% of DOGE's circulating supply. Inflows into these wallets fell 87.52% to a modest 59.86 million coins, while outflows fell to 103.87 million coins, down 29.59% from the previous day.\n\tThis decline coincided with the announcement of the death of dog Kabosu by its owner on social media. Kabosu's image became synonymous with the Doge meme, which later inspired the creation of Dogecoin in 2013. With a current market capitalization of $24.43 billion and daily trading volume approaching $2 billion, Dogecoin has a major place in the cryptocurrency market.\n\t\n\t\n\tWhile a direct link between Kabosu's death and the decline in whale activity remains speculative, it is possible that the emotional resonance associated with the beloved dog may have influenced investor sentiment.\n",

    "content": "\tAI meme cryptocurrencies, i.e., cryptos launched at the intersection between artificial intelligence and meme narratives, are demonstrating brilliant performance in the latest 24 hours. Amid the pale dynamics of the overall crypto market, AI meme tokens and LRTFi/LSDFi categories are outperforming.\n\tIn the last 24 hours, the AI meme crypto category added over 15% in value, pushing total seven-day growth to 100%. As such, this controversial segment that merges the features of two most overhyped narratives of 2023-2024 doubled in value in just one week.\n\tTwo flagship cryptocurrencies of the AI meme group, Turbo (TURBO) and Corgi AI (CORGIAI) are among the largest gainers in the top 250. Turbo (TURBO) added 32.5% in 24 hours, while CorgiAI (CORGIAI) soared by 29.6% and reached $750 million market capitalization.\n\tGrok (GROK), a meme coin behind the \"community of Grok AI enthusiasts\" added 6% and now targets nine-digit valuation for the first time in its history.\n\tAs covered by U.Today previously, Grok is an AI-powered chatbot for Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter). From the very beginning of the project, it garnered attention amid the global crypto community.\n\t\n\t\n\tSome cryptocurrency traders believe that Grok might be useful while searching for trending coins in the short term. However, analysts are warning that Grok might amplify problems with bots on X.\n\tBesides AI meme coins, splendid performance is demonstrated by native coins of decentralized perpetuals trading protocols and assets of staking-associated segments.\n\tLiquid restaking tokens, assets allowing users to earn additional yield from their staked assets by restaking them, are surging today: Pendle (PENDLE) added almost 6% and reached $1 billion valuation. The asset jumped into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\tIn the liquid staking segment, which is considered to be a more conservative one, large gains are demonstrated by the Redacted (BTRFLY) and Origin Ether (OETH) protocols.\n",

    "content": "\tAmid increasing regulatory pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty, a new generation of cryptocurrency users are seeking secure and predictable opportunities to generate yield on their deposits.\n\tCrypto staking might be a smart bet in 2023. Almost all major altcoins are running on this type of blockchain consensus. CryptoStake platform lowers the barrier to entry for staking newbies and makes crypto staking rewards \"antifragile.\"\n\tProof of stake (typically abbreviated as PoS) is a consensus mechanism in blockchain networks that enables the validation of transactions and the creation of new blocks. Unlike proof of work (PoW), which relies on miners solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions, PoS operates differently.\n\tIn a PoS system, validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they \"stake,\" or lock up as collateral. This means that participants who hold a larger amount of the network's native cryptocurrency have a higher chance of being selected as validators and earning rewards. Small players can also \"delegate\" their holdings in favor of this or that validator, and earn a share in their rewards.\n\tEthereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are the two largest proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. In general, this type of consensus is a \"gold standard\" in Web3 as of 2023.\n\tCryptoStake, a multiasset protocol for cryptocurrency staking, offers a secure, resource-efficient and flexible gateway to the crypto staking sphere. Its low-fee service works in a more staker-oriented manner compared to its main competitors.\n\tCryptoStake platform was among the first products to offer a non-custodial wallet for cryptos. Now, it has evolved into a multi-blockchain ecosystem of staking offerings.\n\tIn a nutshell, the platform allows crypto holders to easily become validators of all major PoS blockchains with no need to lock funds to get unpredictable rewards.\n\tSwiss-incorporated cryptocurrency staking service CryptoStake is a newcomer-friendly platform for staking assets on PoS blockchains. It allows cryptocurrency users to deposit and stake Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM) tokens in order to receive periodic rewards.\n\tCryptoStake leverages its own on-chain wallet: the system has no custody over users' assets at any stage of the staking procedure. Users can lock their assets for flexible periods with fixed unstaking limits. For their operations, CryptoStake charges users with fixed 3% fees.\n\tBesides that, the platform prioritizes regulatory-compliant and transparent operations. The platform is designed for customers who require proof of ownership to meet regulatory requirements and for taxation purposes in their jurisdictions. CryptoStake offers a complete reward allocation history for the entire staking period, along with statements suitable for the taxation watchdogs of various countries.\n\tIt works with stakers with various portfolios and staking strategies: there is no need to have a significant stake to join the staking operations on the platform. At the same time, the platform offers comprehensive tooling for large-scale ETH holders. While working with CryptoStake, they can enjoy asset protection during the entire process of staking, the ability to retrieve assets from the wallet without intermediary assistance and consulting support in dealing with tax-related matters.\n\tFrom the onset of its operations, CryptoStake prioritizes the security and flexibility of its operations over whopping APY rates some providers are offering. Also, it champions a transparent and sustainable yield strategy; every user gets rewarded in the same cryptocurrency he or she deposits.\n\tIn this regard, its product is more reliable than that of mainstream liquid staking protocols. Some liquid staking protocols reward contributors in their \"brand\" assets, which are actually low-cap altcoins subject to super-high volatility. Say you lock ETH in some liquid staking protocol, XYZ, receive \"liquid\" synthetic Ethers xyzETH, and get rewarded in XYZCoins. While APY rates can be really impressive, all rewards can lose value during periods of market volatility.\n\tEthereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Polkadot (DOT) are among the largest altcoins: rewards from CryptoStake are much more sustainable and protected from instability.\n\tüîí Curious about the security of https://t.co/h7qgiRbVti? Here's what you need to know: ‚úÖ Full Control of Private Keys: Our apps give you complete control over your private keys, enhancing decentralization and security. (1/3) pic.twitter.com/hXYqstzvpL\n\tAlso, staking with CryptoStake is more secure and attack resistant than locking coins in centralized staking dashboards. Working with such services, users can lose both their stakes and rewards generated as a result of theft or market manipulation. In such services, platforms can also control the keys of the crypto wallets of users.\n\tTechnically, CryptoStake just provides its customers with uninterrupted access to the validator node on a designated server and ensures control over their crypto funds stored in their respective wallets. In other words, the platform is constantly \"renting\" a portion of its validation resources to customers in exchange for small fixed fees.\n\tAs a result, the platform has no control over user funds, passphrases or private keys: users retain full responsibility over their share in the validation process. Every user-driven validator can be restored with only a validator number and user credentials.\n\tBlockchain\n\tEthereum\n\tPolkadot\n\tCosmos\n\tTicker\n\tETH\n\tDOT\n\tATOM\n\tAPY, %\n\t3.34\n\t16.15\n\t21.08\n\tNet staked, B USD\n\t43.5\n\t2.14\n\t1.58\n\tStaked by CryptoStake, M USD\n\t12\n\t8.71\n\t1.25\n\tUnstaking period, days\n\t3-7\n\t28\n\t21\n\tDue to its transparent nature and sustainable yield-generating model, it cannot offer APYs higher than those offered by blockchains themselves.\n\tThe platform relies on its own server infrastructure in New York, Frankfurt and Toronto. All servers used for staking demonstrate availability of 99.9% and higher. Users can operate their stakes via mobile applications that can be downloaded in App Store and Google Play marketplaces.\n\tBesides easy-to-join staking portals and mobile applications, CryptoStake released a clear and convenient staking rewards calculator. It is designed for all types of investors interested in making their strategies predictable and flexible.\n\tWith CryptoStake rewards calculator, potential stakers can find out the ideal size of the stake and token locking period. In the future, the platform is going to roll out staking functions for Bitcoin (BTC) holders. Also, the support for the U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) on Tron (TRC-20) and Tron (TRX) will be added in the wallet while Cardano‚Äôs ADA is expected to land in the staking module by the end of this year.\n\tThis will unlock staking for the community of a $553 billion cryptocurrency and bring fresh inflows of liquidity into the staking sphere. Also, in the near future, the company is going to advance its cold storage solution and start providing a professional licensed custody service.\n\tCryptoStake is a next-gen staking platform for holders of Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM), i.e., the largest PoS coins. Here users borrow shares of its validation power and can get \"native\" rewards instead of payouts in obscure altcoins offered by some services or liquid staking.\n\tThe platform works with fixed performance fees and offers an average APY of over 13%. Periods of unstaking may vary between 3 and 28 days. The platform is fully noncustodial and holds no control over users' funds or credentials.\n",

    "content": "\tIn a brief review, U.Today will debunk the most common myths about the usage of crypto trading bots. We explain how to choose a proper crypto trading bot in 2023 and what features to look at while choosing trading bots.\n\tSince the 2017 bullish rally, crypto trading bots have evolved into a mainstream instrument for high-frequency trading on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. As the number of bots on the market is surging, there are a number of tips newbie traders should care about.\n\tWhen choosing a cryptocurrency trading bot, users should concern themselves most with the following features: the range of exchanges supported, the number of currencies available for automated trading, UX/UI specifications, pricing, the availability of a demo version and the reputation of the service.\n\tAlso, crypto users should be super cautious about the security and integrity of their trading bot service: if API keys are leaked, hackers can drain all the money from an account even if it is inactive for months.\n\tCrypto trading bots are software programs designed to streamline and optimize cryptocurrency trading in an automated manner. Crypto trading bots remove the necessity for human intervention while opening and closing positions on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\tWith crypto trading bots, people can set up their preferred strategy, conditions for placing/canceling orders, deposit money and enjoy their profits. No interaction is needed while the bot is active. Typically, bots charge their users with periodic fees, while some of them also offer free demo versions.\n\tCrypto trading bots are attached to cryptocurrency exchanges, so in order to use one, you need to have an account.\n\tWhen choosing a cryptocurrency trading bot, users should consider several features to avoid losses and hacks and make the trading experience comfortable regardless of one's level of expertise in crypto.\n\tAs such, here are some aspects that should not be overlooked while choosing a bot to use:\n\tAlso, legit bots offer its clients the opportunity to stress test the performance of the bots without paying fees in demo mode with limited functionality.\n\tHere are some trading bots you might be interested in trying this year. They meld the usability, security and feature-rich toolkits and are suitable for both newcomers and seasoned traders.\n\tIntroduced in Q2, 2022, Bitsgap trading bot is incorporated in Estonia. It is the largest fintech hub in the EU and one of the most influential jurisdictions for crypto. Bitsgap offers an ecosystem of crypto trading bots that includes grid trading bots, DCA trading bots, futures trading bots and so on.\n\tGrid trading bot by Bitsgap is a classic solution: it allows users to set up a price interval and make the bot \"buy low, sell high\" within this interval. Also, Bitsgap grid bots can buy Bitcoin (BTC) on every dip or take small U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) profits on price fluctuations in both directions.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tBitsgap's DCA trading bot module leverages the \"holy grail\" of investing in crypto, stocks, FX and commodities markets, i.e., \"dollar-cost-averaging\" strategy. With this strategy, a trader spends a predetermined sum of fiat money per period of time to buy a preferred asset. For instance, Alice spends $1,000 on Bitcoin (BTC) on the first day of every month regardless of the price, while Bob purchases Ethereum (ETH) for $500 once in a fortnight.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tMeanwhile, Bitsgap is among the first crypto trading bots to add advanced versions of this strategy: besides \"Pure DCA\" and \"Custom DCA\" options, it has the opportunity to enhance DCA purchases using MACD+RSI and Stochastic+Channel, two reliable tech analysis indicators.\n\tLast but not least, the Futures trading bot by Bitsgap can automate the processes of placing short and long orders on derivatives exchanges.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tAs of March 2023, Bitsgap supports the largest number of exchanges: it interacts with 15 CEXes, including all the heavyweights: Binance, Bybit, Huobi, Kraken and so on. With Bitsgap, users can trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) and all major altcoins and stablecoins.\n\tVeteran crypto trading bot platform 3 Commas launched in Q4, 2017. Not unlike Bitsgap, it offers a large toolkit of trading bots: DCA Bot, Grid Bot, Options Bot and so on. 3 Commas works with a wide range of centralized exchanges. It also offers a number of unusual functions, including automatic portfolio rebalancing, risk-free paper trading, signal alerts and so on.\n\t\n\t\n\tUnfortunately, in Q4, 2023, 3 Commas bot was targeted by an attack on API keys that resulted in money lost by Binance (BNB) traders.\n\tLaunched in 2018, Zignaly bot ecosystem pioneered the \"profit sharing\" model: it allows newbie traders to copy the trading strategies of professionals sharing some profits with the \"masters.\" From the pure \"trading bots\" model, it switched to \"coinvesting\" and \"revenue sharing\" narratives.\n\tWith Zignaly, newcomers can advance their trading skills, while seasoned traders can benefit from demonstrating their trades to followers.\n\tLaunched in late Q4, 2018, Cryptohoppers is well known for its stack of ready-made solutions for automated trading. Its bots are powered by AI and ML instruments. Its users can purchase fully preconfigured trading bots in a marketplace. DCA, short selling and \"Triggers\" strategies are also available.\n\tCryptohopper has a free \"Pioneer\" tariff for newcomers, while paid tariff plans start from $16.58 per month.\n\tPionex is a centralized cryptocurrency trading platform with 16 built-in trading bots. Over 370 cryptocurrencies are available to its traders with only 0.05% in trading fees. Pionex works in 100+ countries, with its monthly trading volume exceeding $5 billion. Users can trade with bots in both the spot and derivatives segments.\n\tBesides manual trading and bot trading, Pionex offers its users the opportunity to buy crypto, participate in the staking of PoS and DPoS coins and join saving programs.\n\tCrypto trading bots are AI-powered systems that allow users to make their trading automated. With no human intervention needed, they streamline the process of placing and removing orders. In addition, they can perform basic investing strategies, such as \"Dollar-Cost-Averaging\" and so on.\n\tMainstream crypto trading bots are available for free or for paid subscription. They are integrated with centralized exchanges through API instruments.\n\tBitsgap is one of the most technically advanced trading bots that works with 15 CEXes and almost all mainstream cryptocurrencies. Its intuitive interface and feature-rich toolkit makes it the product of choice for both professionals and newcomers.\n",

    "content": "\tWith the broader digital currency ecosystem tilting toward tokenization, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has hinted at some of the important benefits of this technological advancement.\n\tThe concept of tokenization has been flying around, however, only a few understand or know what it really means. Taking to the Ripple Labs‚Äô new X series of explaining a blockchain concept in 60 seconds, the Ripple CTO used real estate to explain the tokenization concept.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe said, with a lot of paperwork involved in buying an asset, it becomes fairly difficult to prove ownership of such properties. He believes tokenization eliminates this challenge by solidifying the process of asset transfer and ownership. He said, with distributed ledger technologies, real estate sales recording, payment for properties and taking away all fraud factors becomes possible.\n\t‚ÄúIf someone can‚Äôt explain something in 60 seconds, they probably don‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù ‚Äî Albert Einstein or Ripple CTO David Schwartz This #CryptoInOneMinute, @joelkatz explains how tokenization enhances efficiency, proving that real understanding doesn't need a full minute.\"‚è±Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/DvMqYuVoNC\n\tHe went on to point out how this ledger simplifies the process of borrowing against an asset. With tokenization, the person‚Äôs collateral can be registered on-chain and the lender can easily verify the ownership of the collateral. Depending on the key designs of the tokenization features, the lender may also gain insight that will show whether or not the person is borrowing from a number of lenders at the same time.\n\tMany financial giants are already trialing tokenization features, with BlackRock also joining the trend. Protocols like Chainlink are specifically helping to fuel this tokenization agenda with its CCIP solution among others.\n\t\n\t\n\tWhile Ripple Labs has not categorically stated the road map in its own tokenization agenda, the firm has immediate plans to launch a stablecoin later this summer. In its latest push, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark for its stablecoin, showing it hopes to use the ticker symbol \"RLUSD.\"\n\tThe stablecoin ecosystem is growing, and Ripple is optimistic to tap into the market in a dominant way.\n",

    "content": "\tPassimPay, a new-gen solution for cryptocurrency payments, offers two types of services. Within one interface, it allows its users to open business and personal accounts and start accepting crypto for private and entrepreneurial use.\n\tLaunched in early 2023, PassimPay employs all the best modern practices in the spheres of crypto payments for individuals and businesses.\n\tAs such, PassimPay attempts to make Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin integrations for businesses easier than ever before.\n\tIt helps businesses to accomplish ambitious milestones in terms of accessibility, massive adoption, profitability and brand visibility through seamless crypto payments integration.\n\tSince the first phase of cryptocurrency adoption in the early 2010s, daily payments have been among the most popular use cases for crypto. The popularity of digital assets as payments for individuals should be attributed to their negligible costs, censorship-resistance, inclusiveness and so on.\n\tIn 2023, crypto payments remain the most decentralized and inclusive instruments for value transfer. To send crypto, users don‚Äôt need to complete bank documentation, pass due diligence checks and so on. However, fully on-chain cryptocurrency wallets still lack intuitive interfaces and 24/7 support. Also, some of them can operate on a single blockchain only. Seed phrases and private key management procedures remain too complicated for newcomers.\n\tThat is why easy-to-use newbie-friendly crypto transfer services with multi-currency support could be the driver for the next wave of crypto adoption.\n\tIn the early 2020s, the interest of modern digital e-commerce services in crypto integrations spiked. First, crypto gateways are easy to integrate: you can add a \"Pay\" button to your website backed by crypto much faster than the alternative service offered by a bank.\n\tThe addition of crypto payments can boost the visibility of this or that brand among young audiences. Integration with global crypto and Web3 ecosystems is a powerful marketing catalyst now.\n\tAlso, by adding the opportunity to pay in crypto, businesses can easily expand into new markets with no need to work on compliance with regulatory demands. The global crypto ecosystem is holistic: an online service does not need to get crypto licenses in every jurisdiction in which it offers payments in crypto.\n\tPassimPay, a global crypto payments system, addresses all major challenges in the crypto transfer segment to allow businesses and individuals to benefit from cutting-edge tech.\n\tPassimPay introduces itself as an easy-to-use, reliable and cost-effective cryptocurrency payments system for personal and entrepreneurial use. In general, PassimPay is designed to let individuals and businessmen use crypto in their personal transactions and operations, removing the need to create cryptocurrency wallets themselves.\n\t\n\tImage by PassimPay\n\tPassimPay accounts can be activated in (literally) three steps: potential users should just sign up, confirm their data with an email address and top up the account. Withdrawals are available immediately upon registration.\n\tTo better focus on the requirements of various types of clients, PassimPay introduced two types of accounts: personal and business accounts. Via both types of accounts, users can store, send, receive and exchange cryptocurrency. All operations of PassimPay users are secured by modern crypto protection practices. The developers employed network and application firewalls, multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection, an emergency back-up toolkit, a security accident management mechanism, as well as SSL certificates and a DDoS protection kit provided by Cloudflare.\n\tAll products of the PassimPay ecosystem are flexible: even users with no previous experience in blockchain and cryptocurrencies can easily customize the settings to adjust PassimPay for their requirements.\n\tPersonal accounts of PassimPay are designed for cryptocurrency users interested in storing their digital assets with an easy-to-use, fast and cheap service.

Once registered, users can enjoy instant payments: PassimPay confirms crypto transfers between accounts in seconds.\n\tThe platform offers an attractive fee scheme for individuals. While transfers themselves are charged with zero fees, withdrawals from PassimPay are available for a 0.1-1% commission.\n\tIn an account dashboard, PassimPay users can track their operations history, activity log, conversion rates, total balance and transfer statuses, as well as all information about services available for PassimPay users. The crypto portfolio is also displayed in the dashboard, while transaction history and balance details can be downloaded in .CSV format.\n\tBesides the crypto payments module, PassimPay offers feature-rich tooling for businesses in e-commerce, marketplace, PoS terminals and so on. Just like personal accounts, business accounts can store and transfer cryptocurrency, but they also support advanced reporting and accounting features.\n\t\n\tImage by PassimPay\n\tTo start with, PassimPay works with secure API instruments: PassimPay business accounts can be linked to projects (websites) in just a few clicks.\n\tWith the advanced reports option, users can check the status of all operations and balance history online 24/7: the relevant files can be downloaded without additional preliminary requests. Besides that, users can set up notifications to get alerts about all events in their corporate accounts operated by teams or managers.\n\tJust like all other services of PassimPay, its business account works with very low fees.

    "content": "\tWhile crypto markets are still trapped in a bearish recession, owners of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins badly need low-fee and reliable opportunities to swap their cryptos among each other. Launched by a heavy-hitting team of blockchain veterans, FixedFloat exchange addresses the major bottlenecks of the segment.\n\tSince 2018, FixedFloat exchange is offering a low-fee, reliable and seamless crypto conversion instrument for all users of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and major altcoins.\n\tWhich features make FixedFloat special in Q4, 2022, and why is it increasingly popular among Web3 users?\n\tA cryptocurrency exchange is a class of blockchain-based services designed to allow Internet users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another. In general, it is a software that ensures cross-asset conversion for digital coins.\n\tIn general, a cryptocurrency exchange works not unlike a traditional currency exchange: a user sends his/her deposit in one currency in order to immediately receive the equivalent sum in another cryptocurrency. Some exchanges also have direct crypto-to-fiat conversion options.\n\tPeople use crypto exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies, to store and rebalance their portfolios, to receive crypto from their peers and so on. The first-ever cryptocurrency exchange ‚Äî the now-defunct Bitcoinmarket.com ‚Äî was launched in March 2010; it only supported swaps between Bitcoin (BTC) and U.S. Dollars (USD).\n\tAccording to CoinMarketCap, a leading tracker of cryptocurrencies and blockchain services as of August 2022, there are 523 legitimate exchanges for crypto. As such, finding the right one might not be an easy task.\n\tCentralized cryptocurrency exchanges use centralized custodial mechanisms to store user funds or private keys. They actually control users' accounts and can block assets voluntarily. At the same time, they have well-designed and intuitive interfaces, good pricing, low fees and typically have more trading instruments than their decentralized counterparts.\n\tBinance (BNB), Coinbase, FTX (FTT), Bitfinex, Huobi (HT) and KuCoin (KCS) are popular centralized exchanges.\n\tBy contrast, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges do not store user money or keys. All interactions between the exchange and its users are fully automated. Typically, they have more sophisticated interfaces and mediocre toolkits.\n\tUniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE) and 1Inch (1INCH) are mainstream decentralized (on-chain) exchanges.\n\tLightning Network is a second-layer payments protocol on top of the Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) networks. It is designed to address the problem of low speed and insufficient scalability of Bitcoin-like blockchains. By default, Bitcoin (BTC) can only process three transactions per second.\n\tAs the adoption of cryptocurrencies gains traction, this throughput is not enough for Bitcoiners any longer. That is why, in 2017, developers decided to implement payment channel infrastructure on top of the Bitcoin (BTC) network.\n\tWith Lightning Network, transactional data is partially processed off-chain; Bitcoin (BTC) mainnet is only used to verify the data. That is why Lighting payments are far faster and charged with dramatically reduced fees.\n\tFixedFloat, a KYC-agnostic multi-blockchain exchange, leverages the disruptive power of Lightning Network to guarantee the lowest possible fees and fast transaction verification.\n\tTechnically, FixedFloat is a web interface for exchanging cryptocurrencies amongst each other: to start working with FixedFloat, no extra downloads, registrations or installations are required. FixedFloat was launched in 2018 by a team of seasoned professionals in fintech, blockchain, tech and entrepreneurship.\n\tFixedFloat is designed to ensure the noncustodial exchange of cryptocurrencies launched on different blockchains. FixedFloat only uses hot wallets: to guarantee maximum security and attack-resistance, the platform does not send users‚Äô funds to cold wallets during the exchange process.\n\tFixedFloat prioritizes the anonymity of its users: it has no KYC (‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù) screening. To use the exchanges, crypto holders do not need to register an account. The only thing needed to start exchanging crypto with FixedFloat is to connect the target crypto wallet. However, to track their history of operations, users can register an account.\n\tFixedFloat supports a wide range of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT, USDC and other major cryptocurrencies. Namely, it supports mainstream proof-of-stake (PoS) coins like Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Tezos (XTZ), Polkadot (DOT) and Tronics (TRX).\n\tPrivacy coins Monero (XMR) and ZCash (ZEC) are available together with key stablecoins USDT (Ethereum, BNB Chain and Tron version), USDC (Ethereum, BNB Chain and Tron version), Dai (DAI), TrueUSD (TUSD) and crypto veterans Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC) and XRP.\n\tThe FixedFloat platform supports two exchange modes: with fixed and floating rates, respectively. With fixed rates, the client knows the exact sum he/she gets and is charged with a 1% commission. With a floating rate, the client is subject to price fluctuations: he/she only knows the exact sum after the exchange is over. Floating rate exchange operations are charged with a 0.5% fee.\n\tIn order to exchange cryptocurrency on FixedFloat, a crypto user should take three intuitive steps:\n\tThat‚Äôs it! The system is ready to start the exchange. If a user wants to exchange Bitcoin (BTC), he/she also has the option to organize the exchange through Lightning Network.\n\tTo allow its users to benefit from their social media exposure, FixedFloat launched a multi-level affiliate program. FixedFloat users can spread the word about its services, invite friends to try the exchange and receive a portion of their transactional fees.\n\tFixedFloat is well known for its 24/7 online customer support. On all major third-party review websites, it is ranked among the top B2B crypto services. To name a few, on TrustPilot, it is ranked 4.9/5 with 1,697 reviews, while on BestChanger, there are hundreds of positive comments about FixedFloat.\n\tFixedFloat is a noncustodial cross-blockchain exchange that supports Bitcoin (BTC), all major altcoins and stablecoins. It leverages Lightning Network to advance Bitcoin (BTC) trading and supports fixed and floating exchange rates.\n\tFixedFloat has feature-rich API toolkit, 24/7 support, a generous affiliate program and a passionate community.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Crypto App, an all-in-one cryptocurrency tracking, analytics and content platform, allows crypto traders and holders to advance their understanding of crypto markets, to create and implement data-driven trading strategies and to enhance risk management methods.\n\tLaunched in early 2020, The Crypto App is among the most powerful data tracking applications for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\tIt merges the benefits of a portfolio tracker, content indexer, alerts system and data aggregator.\n\tAs such, The Crypto App is setting industry standards in data availability, accuracy, speed and user-friendliness and helps introduce Web3 to the next generation of users worldwide.\n\tPortfolio trackers are software programs (desktop or mobile applications, web interfaces) designed to visualize and analyze the prices of assets: commodities, stocks, digital or fiat currencies. Unlike news websites, portfolio trackers have customizable interfaces: their users can only track chosen assets with no need to pay attention to their competitors.\n\tPortfolio trackers allow asset holders to stay informed about the price and supply dynamics of their assets, providing a clear picture of the changes in the value of their overall asset portfolio.\n\tPortfolio trackers aggregate data from various centralized and decentralized data vendors to keep their information accurate and up to date..\n\tFirst of all, reliable and easy-to-use crypto trackers are a must-have for cryptocurrency traders, in particular for those who leverage high-frequency trading strategies, automated trading or other short-term strategies. They cannot afford to miss a notification about a rapid price change: it might damage their \"short\" and \"long\" positions and cause painful liquidations. This is even more sensitive for those who trade with high leverage.\n\tIn addition, midterm and long-term investors also rely on cryptocurrency trackers. These platforms can help that class of investors reassess their portfolios, identify promising assets, and remove risky coins.\n\tIn addition, crypto trackers are used by a wide range of cryptocurrency enthusiasts as sources of data analytics and educational content. Cryptocurrency newbies can take baby steps with such platforms, while seasoned crypto holders can identify new trends, get valuable insights and so on.\n\tThe Crypto App is focused on delivering best-in-class tools, content and analytics and delivering an unmatched experience to crypto enthusiasts globally.\n\tFirst and foremost, The Crypto App is a high-performance cryptocurrency portfolio tracker. This means that it displays digital asset data and dynamics in real time. In total, its customers can monitor over 6,000 coins (almost every coin registered on CMC) across 100+ platforms.\n\tBesides the coin name, ticker, logo, price and activity for the last 24 hours, The Crypto App broadcasts all information needed to properly evaluate the performance of various coins including market capitalization, trading volume, price performance in the last week/months, competitors and so on. Such an extensive selection of data is crucial for those who adhere to the old traders' motto: \"When in doubt, zoom out.\" That is why The Crypto App can help users to find \"the next big thing\" with minimum effort.\n\tFor experienced traders, The Crypto App team added various technical analysis indicators. Traders can customize the indicators, oscillators, moving average lines (MAs) and so on to accurately predict the price performance of cryptocurrencies.\n\tThe Crypto App delivers on its primary objective of serving as an all-in-one platform that can be seamlessly integrated with various custodial and noncustodial wallets. With it, users can monitor multiple accounts using a single interface. For example, a trader who stores a portion of their assets on Binance and other centralized exchanges for short-term trades while keeping the rest on TrustWallet and MetaMask can now use one portfolio tracker instead of multiple ones.\n\tThis level of functionality is achieved through a toolkit of API integrations that includes support for various networks such as the largest blockchain Bitcoin (BTC), major EVM-compatible blockchains Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon Network (MATIC), Solana (SOL) and so on.\n\tAlso, traders can set up all necessary parameters in a couple of clicks: The Crypto App interface requires minimal customization effort.\n\tThe Crypto App offers a number of widgets to make the portfolio tracking experience even more seamless and resource-efficient. With the app‚Äôs widgets, traders can see all of the most important information on the markets or their portfolios updated in real time on their smartphones' screens.\n\t\n\tImage by The Crypto App\n\tPrice alerts can also inform users of all critical events on the crypto market even when The Crypto App is closed and inactive. Users can customize all alerts and set push notifications for predetermined assets.\n\tIn total, The Crypto App has over four million downloads. It is rated 4.5/5 on major digital portals; its users shared more than 84,000 reviews.\n\tThe Crypto App has recently taken its offering to the next level by announcing the launch of its Pro and Pro+ subscription-based services, products designed to assist crypto enthusiasts, traders and investors in making informed decisions in the crypto space. By partnering with crypto intelligence brands such as IntoTheBlock, TradingView and Messari, The Crypto App has curated the most advanced market insights into one service offering.\n\tThe Pro subscription includes a variety of features such as 42 proprietary signals and metrics on the crypto market powered by AI-data leader IntoTheBlock, advanced charts enhanced with TradingView indicators, expanded portfolio tracker, real-time alert and personalized widget offerings and access to trading pair data across various crypto exchanges.\n\tMeanwhile, the Pro+ subscription is designed for in-depth researchers and longer-term investors and includes all of the Pro features as well as exclusive access to professional research reports provided by crypto intelligence leader Messari.\n\tAdditionally, Pro and Pro+ subscribers can benefit from special discounts and promotions from leading digital services and consumer brands. Users can subscribe to Pro for $8.99 per month or Pro+ for $14.99 per month, and anyone can register for a week-long, free trial of either service by downloading The Crypto App on Google Play or Apple‚Äôs iOS App Store.\n\tThe Pro and Pro+ options offer a robust service that delivers exceptional insights at an unbeatable price, enabling both crypto beginners and experts to easily access the most reliable and valuable information required to make informed investment and trading choices.\n\t\n\tImage by The Crypto App\n\tThe ad-supported \"Basic\" plan of the app, encompassing all fundamental features such as token insights, a portfolio tracker for up to three exchanges and five wallets, and the ability to track five crypto conversion pairs, is available to all users for free.\n\tThe Crypto App is a cutting-edge platform that serves as a cryptocurrency tracker, analytical tool, and content hub, all rolled into one. By keeping traders updated on the latest prices, news, and information related to the crypto industry, it provides valuable insights to those looking to elevate their investment game. The app's comprehensive approach to the market makes it an asset for crypto enthusiasts and traders alike, and it's difficult to find a similar offering in the market.\n",

    "content": "\tAs more and more real world assets are being brought on-chain, new opportunities are getting unlocked for the next generation of investors.\n\tInstant, secure and transparent tokenization mechanisms supercharge Acquire.Fi (ACQ), making it the go-to platform for retail and institutional investors focused on M&A deals and investment pools.\n\tIntroduced in Q1, 2022, Acquire.Fi and its ACQ token are designed to build a framework for more inclusive, democratic, safe and regulatory-compliant investing in tokenized assets. Thus, it champions a seamless TradFi-to-DeFi transition and injects fresh liquidity into various promising products.\n\tHere‚Äôs what makes Acquire.Fi‚Äôs stack of instruments unique and important for the next phase of global Web3 adoption:\n\tAcquire.Fi‚Äôs progress is helmed by a heavy-hitting team of veterans in DeFi, blockchain development, the M&A segment and e-commerce.\n\tMergers and acquisitions (M&A) are a specific class of transactions that allow companies, firms, communities and other business entities to be transferred or consolidated with other entities.\n\tIn terms of business strategy, M&A deals are designed to allow enterprises to grow or augment their businesses.\n\tIn Web2 economics, M&A deals are typically carried out through special investment firms (investment banks); top tier M&A consultants are called ‚Äúbulge bracket banks.‚Äù\n\t‚ÄúClassic‚Äù M&A procedures are almost inaccessible to retail investors. They require significant human, financial and organizational resources, high-profile experts, costly KYC/AML/CFT checks, due diligence and so on.\n\tBlockchains, as transparent, low-cost and accessible platforms for everyone, provide a new-gen technical basis for blockchain deals. In this sphere, the concepts of tokenization and fractionalized ownership allow retail investors to purchase a fraction of new companies that emerge as a result of M&A deals.\n\tM&A deals themselves become more resource-efficient and frictionless with crypto as a technical platform: crypto companies can acquire each other through purchasing large portions of governance or utility tokens.\n\tAcquire.Fi (ACQ), a novel platform for M&A deals, fractionalized ownership and assets tokenization, goes live to unlock new opportunities for retail investors and streamline M&A processes for Web3 businesses.\n\tAcquire.Fi goes live to create a holistic ‚ÄúWeb3 platform‚Äù that bridges the TradFi and DeFi worlds. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) ‚Äî will be streamlined with a low legal burden thanks to Acquire.Fi‚Äôs M&A ecosystem.\n\tFor the first time in corporate finance history, Acquire.Fi is going to introduce unpublished deals, confidential M&A alpha, investor matchmaking and buyer support to average investors with low-to-middle deposits.\n\tAcquire.Fi‚Äôs investing pools, therefore, change the narrative in portfolio diversification. Fractionalized ownership and yield-bearing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will allow making fractions of companies sellable on third-party marketplaces.\n\tThat being said, Acquire.Fi targets building a DeFi/TradFi ecosystem designed to streamline M&A processes and to make them accessible to every investor.\n\tTechnically, Acquire.Fi is set to become a first-ever M&A marketplace in the crypto and Web3 segments. To achieve this ambitious goal, Acquire.Fi strives to build a marketplace of investment pools.\n\tWith Acquire.Fi‚Äôs pools, all investors will have access to the same opportunities. All users of Acquire.Fi products can leverage acquisitions as wealth building tools.\n\tInvestment pools for Acquire.Fi clients will allow them to take part in crowdfunding to acquisitions and fractionalized ownership.\n\tCrypto users will be able to access diverse asset types, risk factors and investment opportunities.\n\tAll projects will be displayed on the ‚Äúmarketplace,‚Äù the only marketplace of Web3 innovation. All relevant information about the listings will be displayed through the marketplace, i.e., launch date, USP and value proposition details, estimated net profits, team score (assigned by Acquire.Fi‚Äôs experts), seller interviews and so on.\n\t\n\tImage by Acquire.Fi\n\tAcquire.Fi marketplace will earn revenue in a transparent and predictable model: the marketplace will charge its listed products with a 3% marketplace fee, 3% escrow fee, 6% introducer fee and one-time $500 listing fee.\n\tAcquire.Fi‚Äôs NFTs will allow: clients to purchase a fraction of a Web3 company or IP, and immediately list it on a third-party marketplace, including the likes of OpenSea, Rarible and so on. Acquire.Fi is the first-ever marketplace to allow its users to purchase fractions of the next big thing and sell it immediately without bulky legal and financial procedures.\n\tTo underpin its economic model, Acquire.Fi introduced its core native utility and governance token, ACQ, on Ethereum (ETH) blockchain as an ERC-20 asset. Its total supply will be capped at 300 million tokens.\n\tIts initial circulating supply will be set at 750,000 tokens. ACQ will be available for investors at $0.0225 (angel phase) to $ 0.09 (public sale phase). The hard cap of its tokensale will be set at $5,062,500.\n\tFrom the release of the platform, ACQ token staking dashboard will go live. Stakers will be able to leverage exclusive opportunities. Staking 100 ACQ will unlock the way to Tier 1 with basic investment allocation and governance voting rights, while the staking of 42,000 ACQ will allow investors to join the Governance Council, get holding rewards and to list their products with reduced escrow fees and zero listing fees.\n\tAcquire.Fi (ACQ) is an ecosystem designed to allow buyers and sellers of Web3 innovation to interact seamlessly. Through fractionalized ownership and crowdfunding, it allows retail investors to take part in M&A deals and various investment campaigns.\n\tAcquire.Fi‚Äôs ACQ token is a building block of the protocol‚Äôs tokenomics: it acts as a governance and utility token that allows holders to enjoy premium investing opportunities and take part in the platform‚Äôs governance procedures.\n",

    "content": "\tShiba Inu (SHIB) price action has gained attention in recent days as it battled a much-watched key resistance.\n\tHowever, the latest developments indicate a stall in the SHIB rally, prompting a closer examination of market trends, on-chain data and technical indicators.\n\tThe crux of the SHIB price action is a key price range between $0.000024 and $0.000026, where 58.91 trillion SHIB were bought by 63,840 addresses at an average price of $0.000025, according to IntoTheBlock data.\n\tAs SHIB approached the 58 trillion token threshold, the momentum that had propelled its price began to wane. This level has become a critical point of resistance, where bullish sentiment started to falter.\n\t\n\t\n\tShiba Inu steadily declined for three days after reaching highs of $0.00002684 on May 22. Price rebounded before selling resumed with SHIB battling to stay above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 in today's trading session.\n\tAt the time of writing, SHIB was relinquishing its prior day gains, down 0.08% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002482.\n\tAlthough the exact reason for the SHIB price slowdown remains unknown, market dynamics and other factors might have come into play.\n\tThe slowing at this point might suggest that the market is taking a moment to consolidate gains and consider the next move. Traders may be taking profits, while others could be waiting for a clearer signal to take action. Additionally, the overall sentiment in the crypto market plays a crucial role, as broader market trends often influence the performance of individual tokens.\n\t\n\t\n\tFor SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it might likely need to overcome the 58 trillion SHIB threshold with renewed buying interest. The broader market movements may also need to be monitored to determine the SHIB price's next move.\n\tIf the market regains momentum, a break past the $0.00002684 level might be needed to ascertain the start of a SHIB upside move. If this happens, SHIB might target the $0.00003285 level. In this scenario, SHIB might need to sustain above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 to prevent further declines.\n\tIf SHIB drops below the daily SMA 50 level, support is envisaged at $0.00002334 and $0.00002155.\n",

    "content": "\tMainstream cryptocurrency trading ecosystem BYDFi (formerly BitYard) merges the benefits of a spot and derivatives exchange platform. It also offers lucrative welcome bonuses and a generous affiliate program.\n\tSince its launch in 2020, the platform has gained a stellar reputation; its team constantly adds new options to its trading and exchange toolkits. In this review, we are going to observe its core features and the most impressive opportunities it unlocks for traders.\n\tThanks to its intuitive interface, 24/7 support and feature-rich range of crypto conversion instruments, BYDFi is gaining traction in various regions across the globe.\n\tAs such, BYDFi aims at being a one-stop cryptocurrency ecosystem for traders and investors with various deposits and Web3 strategies from all over the globe.\n\tJust like on commodities, stocks and foreign exchange (FX) markets, crypto derivatives represent contracts on future prices of this or that asset. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) futures are contracts on Bitcoin (BTC) price moves in both directions. With crypto derivatives, users can benefit from volatility spikes on both bullish and bearish markets.\n\tCrypto derivatives trading also allows exchange users to be exposed to new classes of assets without owning cryptocurrency. You don‚Äôt need to own Bitcoin (BTC) physically to start trading derivatives: you can set up a crypto wallet, save and manage private keys, connect the wallet to an exchange and so on.\n\tBYDFi is a cutting-edge trading platform for cryptocurrencies. It is set to offer secure and comfortable trading for spot and derivatives pairs across 400+ cryptocurrencies.\n\tLaunched in 2020 as BitYard exchange, BYDFi (short for BUIDL Your Dream Finance) gained traction as a multi-product ecosystem for crypto investors, traders, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts. First, it is a convenient spot and derivatives crypto exchange.\n\tIn the ‚ÄúSpot‚Äù section, users can easily exchange cryptos between each other. BYDFi supports 400+ cryptocurrencies in the spot trading module. It works with crypto heavyweights Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), trending metaverse coins Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA) and Smooth Love Potion (SLP), ‚ÄúChina narrative‚Äù coins Coinflux (CFX) and Nervos Network (CKB).\n\tIn order to let its customers adjust their portfolios swiftly, BYDFi created ‚Äútabs‚Äù according to all red-hot narratives: GameFi coins, L2 coins, PoW coins and so on. For maximum comfort, BYDFi offers classic, advanced and simple one-click interfaces of spot trading toolkits.\n\tIn the ‚ÄúDerivatives‚Äù segment, traders can try two major types of futures contracts: USDT-M Perpetual Contracts and COIN-M Perpetual Contracts. USDT-M are settled in U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), the largest USD-pegged stablecoin and crypto equivalent of the U.S. Dollar. By contrast, COIN-M Perpetual Contracts are settled in underlying cryptocurrencies.\n\tUp to 100 trading pairs are available in the USDT-M section, while BTCUSD, XRPUSD, ETHUSD and DOTUSD contracts are also available in the COIN-M section. All contracts available on BYDFi are ‚ÄúPerpetuals‚Äù: they don‚Äôt have expiration dates, which makes trading more streamlined.\n\tIn order to start trading cryptocurrencies, a BYDFi user should purchase their first coins ‚Äî typically, crypto newbies start with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT). Buying cryptocurrencies with fiat is the easiest option here: traders don‚Äôt need to risk while purchasing cryptos on ‚Äúover-the-counter‚Äù desks or through ATMs.\n\tIn the ‚ÄúBuy Crypto‚Äù module by BYDFi, users can buy cryptos with credit/debit cards, bank transfers, crypto-friendly payment systems and even Google Pay/Apple Pay accounts.\n\t\n\tImage by BYDFi\n\tUnlike many competitors, BYDFi enabled the purchasing of dozens of cryptos with cards, from Bitcoin (BTC) and U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) to 1Inch (1INCH), Aave Finance (AAVE) and SushiSwap (SUSHI). It also accepts all major world fiat currencies, including U.S. Dollars, Euros, Australian Dollars, UAE Dirhams and Swiss Francs.\n\tTo guarantee deep liquidity and seamless conversion experience in various jurisdictions, BYDFi partnered with four top-tier crypto-to-fiat conversion providers Mercuryo, Banxa, Transak and Coinify. They accept Visa, MasterCard, SEPA transfers, Google Pay and Apple Pay transactions. For some pairs, 0% fees are available: for instance, with Transak, you can exchange 1 USD for 1 USDT (for up to $1,500 in equivalent) in 2-10 minutes.\n\tIn order to comply with international regulations, all traders on BYDFi should pass ‚ÄúKnow Your Customers‚Äù checks after registration.\n\tBesides classic instruments for spot and derivatives segments, BYDFi integrated a number of next-gen options designed to optimize trading experience for newbies and pro traders.

    "content": "\tOne of the largest crypto exchanges globally - \"people‚Äôs exchange\" KuCoin - shares the details of its largest promo campaign of September 2022. A total of $1 million USDT equivalent will be distributed between the participants of the Terra Classic (LUNC) trading initiative.\n\tBoth cryptocurrency veterans and newbies can deposit Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens, activate trading bots and experiment with various trading strategies to win lucrative prizes from the KuCoin exchange team.\n\tStarting from Sept. 7, 2022, KuCoin‚Äôs traders of Terra Classic (LUNC) is able to compete for lucrative bonuses, USDT rewards and discount coupons. KuCoin invites new and existing users to take part in various programs related to the event.\n\tThe campaign will be running until Sept. 14, 2022 (12:00 p.m. UTC). The owners of VIP and Regular statuses can take part in the activity.\n\tTerra (LUNA) was a programmatic blockchain and platform for decentralized applications. It was launched in 2018 by Korea-based software team Terraform Labs. Do Kwon and Daniel Shin were its key figureheads.\n\tThe platform was well known due to its native cryptocurrency, Terra (LUNA), an algorithmically-backed dollar-pegged stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and Anchor Protocol (ANC) DeFi machine that allows crypto holders to earn up to 19.5% in APY on all UST deposits.\n\tIn May 2022, Terra (LUNA) ecosystem collapsed as Anchor Protocol (ANC) proved to be unsustainable. Both UST and LUNA dropped to almost zero levels, erasing over $45 billion in crypto market capitalization.\n\tDue to this dramatic collapse, Terra (LUNA) blockchain was halted to prevent users and traders from unforeseen consequences. However, it was restarted under its initial name; now the restarted chain is again working as Terra (LUNA), helmed by Do Kwon.\n\tAt the same time, the large and passionate Terra community decided to support the progress and operations of the \"original'' version of the blockchain. Not unlike Ethereum (ETH) after the DAO Fork, it was decided to call the community-driven network Terra Classic (LUNC).\n\tBy the end of Q3, 2022, Terra Classic (LUNC) gained massive popularity: with over $3.5 billion in market capitalization, it has already exploded into the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap (CoinMarketCap, September 2022). In August, it underwent a massive upgrade: its codebase was updated at the block height of 9,109,990.\n\tLaunched in 2017, KuCoin established itself as the \"people‚Äôs exchange\" due to its unmatched user-friendliness, feature-rich toolkit and rapidly growing set of trading pairs. KuCoin is a top 5 cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume (CoinMarketCap, 2022), one of the Best Crypto Exchanges (Forbes, 2021) and the Best Crypto App for enthusiasts (Ascent, 2022).\n\tAs covered by U.Today previously, KuCoin supports 700 cryptocurrencies in spot and futures trading dashboards, accepts deposits in the KuCoin Earn module and offers seamless zero-fee NFT trading on its marketplace, Windvane. Most recently, it unveiled native IEO launchpad KuCoin Spotlight for the most promising early-stage products.\n\tKuCoin Community Chain (KCC) is an EVM-compatible smart contracts platform run by KuCoin community enthusiasts.\n\tTo signal support for the most crucial upgrade in the \"new old\" Terra, KuCoin introduces its massive promotional campaign for new and existing users. LUNC holders can share $1 million in USDT for just depositing and trading their tokens.\n\tFirst, LUNC holders can win USDT bonuses and fee deduction coupons by using trading bots, i.e., automated trading systems required to place and execute buy/sell orders. The category of prize depends on the trading volume processed by this or that user within the promo period.\n\tThe KuCoin team highlights that any trading bot strategy is valid; only trading volume matters for the final leaderboard.\n\tThis part of the promo is the easiest one to join. As such, it is the best one for crypto newbies and new members of the LUNC community. To be eligible for the airdrop within the LUNC trading campaign by KuCoin, users should just generate trading volume by deals in all LUNC-based trading pairs.\n\tBetween Sept. 7 and Sept. 14, spot traders on KuCoin should complete a LUNC trading task to share the 10,000 USDT prize pool equally to the trading volume generated by each other in the Rewards Hub:\n\tQualified users will share the prize pool equally once the task ends.\n\tLast but not least, the KuCoin team decided to support a crucial economic update for the Terra Classic (LUNC) ecosystem. As per the proposal by Terra (LUNC) enthusiasts, every on-chain transaction on Terra Classic (LUNC) will be charged with a 1.2 % fee.\n\tFrom 0 to 1.2%, will #LUNC's Tax Burn Proposal bring new excitement? Find more! üëá\n\tShould this proposal pass, KuCoin exchange would immediately support this sensitive change. However, to protect the deposits from unpredictable losses, KuCoin strongly recommends its customers to deposit/withdraw LUNC assets before Sept. 12, which is an estimated date of \"burning tax\" activation.\n\tKuCoin, one of the largest CEXes, launches a LUNC trading competition. To get lucrative bonuses and fee discounts, crypto users are invited to deposit and exchange their LUNC tokens.\n\tUsers of trading bots can get bonuses for 10,000 USDT+ trading volume, while all LUNC enthusiasts with 100,000,000 LUNC deposits and larger can enjoy VIP1-VIP4 status.\n\tAlso, KuCoin is ready to support a 1.2% tax proposal on all LUNC on-chain transactions.\n",

    "content": "\tXRP, the seventh largest cryptocurrency, faces a crucial test as it makes frantic efforts to establish a fresh price move. The outcome of this test could determine its short-term price trajectory, with a potential breakout paving the way for significant gains.\n\tTechnical analysis pinpoints a key resistance level that could pave the way for XRP price's upward trajectory.\n\tIf XRP can break above this resistance, it could trigger a surge in buying activity, pushing the price toward higher targets. Conversely, failure to break through might extend the current consolidation or a potential pullback.\n\tThe resistance level at $0.578, which coincides with the daily SMA 200, has been identified as key for the XRP price. This level along with the daily SMA 50 at $0.529 had constricted XRP price since mid-April. XRP recently saw a breakout past the daily SMA 50, leaving it with the daily SMA 200 to contend with.\n\tA successful breach of this barrier could signal a bullish reversal, potentially leading to a 40% rise and allowing XRP to reclaim its March high of $0.748. However, before it can reach this high, it must first overcome barrier levels at $0.642 and $0.662. This scenario also depends on XRP sustaining above the daily SMA 50.\n\tIn light of this, market analysts are closely watching XRP price action for signals of potential breakout.\n\t\n\t\n\tHowever, if XRP fails to break the resistance, it may extend its current consolidation phase, trading within a range while awaiting new catalysts to drive momentum. A pullback could see XRP retesting support levels around $0.50 or lower. Conversely, a breakdown below $0.467 could lead to a bearish scenario that might lead to a retest of the $0.42 level.\n\tAt the time of writing, XRP was down 0.19% in the last 24 hours to $0.535, per CoinMarketCap data.\n\tWith the market's eyes fixed on these developments, the coming days could be pivotal for XRP's price. Whether it will surge past the identified resistance levels or face a setback remains to be seen.\n",

Prior to that, leading ETF industry analysts as well as major banking players of the likes of Standard Chartered claimed that these products were unlikely to be approved.\n\t\n\t\n\tAfter the news about imminent ETF approval broke on social media, the Ether price entered a major uptrend, surging from $3,600 to $3,900 in a span of just three days.\n\tDespite the major bullish catalyst, the leading altcoin has so far failed to gain a footing above the $4,000 level. It is also down 19.8% from its all-time high.\n\t\n\t\n\tAccording to 100eyes Crypto Scanner, the Ethereum price has seen bullish divergence on the hourly time frame. This bearish pattern occurs when an asset manages to make new highs, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) records slower highs. Based on this particular chart, it is clear that Ethereum is currently experiencing weakening momentum despite the substantial price increase. The RSI recorded a lower high in the 65-70 range after Ether surged to $3,900, which is the main horizontal resistance level.\n\tüö® Crypto alert: [#ETH-#USDT] RSI Bearish Divergence (1h) [#ETH-#USDT] Near Horizontal Resistance (1h) pic.twitter.com/N8sbRZhdVw\n\tIf the bearish divergence ends up playing out, the price of the chief altcoin could experience a pullback from the current level.

    "content": "\tBoth start-ups and established market actors are forced to cut their headcounts, cease yield farming programs and even close popular services for retail and institutional clients amid a painful Crypto Winter.\n\tHowever, Gate.io, a veteran cryptocurrency exchange, has changed its fees policy to support market makers who inject liquidity into the platform. They can now enjoy the most competitive rates and generous rebates in the market.\n\tStarting from August 2022, Gate.io will enable upgrades to its fee structure, introducing immense benefits for various tiers of traders and slightly changing VIP tier conditions.\n\tSo what is happening to fees on Gate.io? And how can traders benefit from these adjustments?\n\tIn short, Gate.io introduced one of the most attractive and competitive fee structures for market makers to ensure the sustainability and progress of its liquidity ecosystem as well as the best prices for all assets and trading pairs.\n\tLaunched in 2013, Gate.io is among the leading centralized cryptocurrency ecosystems in the Web3 segment. It champions an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù approach: Gate.io employed spot and futures trading dashboards, a one-click ‚ÄúBuy Crypto‚Äù function, native initial exchange offering (Blockchain Projects Discounts) launchpad Gate.io Startup and an array of applications for different devices.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe platform has the largest selections of coins among all the mainstream exchanges; 1,400 coins are available in over 2,500 trading pairs. Gate.io launches dedicated initiatives to onboard fans of the DeFi and NFT segments.\n\tAlso, the exchange is well known for its balanced and flexible community management strategy. Over nine years of operations, Gate.io managed to build a credible brand and establish strong relationships with institutions. Gate.io experts assist the platform‚Äôs clients in optimization of trading strategies, risk management, liquidity logistics and so on.\n\tGate.io announced a new logo and started a full-scale rebranding of all its elements to celebrate its ninth anniversary in early June 2022.\n\tIn recent years, Gate.io relentlessly reaffirmed its commitment to building attractive products for institutional investors and large-scale sophisticated traders. Gate.io offers high market depth and unmatched liquidity volumes for these categories of users. These clients work with GIS (Gate Institutional Services) who provide operation support to market makers, hedge funds, brokers and so on.\n\tTo stimulate the activity of market makers ‚Äî who are crucial actors on modern Web3 exchanges, both centralized and decentralized ‚Äî large-scale exchanges introduce marketmaker rebates. Rebates (or ‚Äúnegative fees‚Äù) are a form of incentive designed to boost the trading activity of market makers on a centralized exchange.\n\tTechnically, rebates are only introduced for the largest clients in order to keep the exchanges' revenue strategies in a balanced and sustainable manner. However, all users regardless of their deposit size can benefit from the increase in liquidity inflows which results in more competitive price and higher order execution speed.\n\tIn late Q3, 2022, Gate.io changed its fee structure by introducing new tiers for its users and Gate.io adjusted VIP tier requirements with better maker rebates.\n\tWith the fee policy update, traders' status now depends not on the amount of their deposit in Gate.io‚Äôs exchange token GT but solely on a 30-day trading volume. Previously, the two factors were counted in combination, but now the team has decided to prioritize trading volume.\n\t\n\tImage by Gate.io\n\tVIP upgrades are now available for three groups of large-scale and active users of Gate.io. Namely, the list of options required to get VIP status includes the following:\n\tThen, market makers can enjoy the largest rebates on the market. Rebates go live as a part of the Market Maker Program which uses the MM tiers for maker fees. Namely, the Gate.io ecosystem introduces up to 0.012% rebates for spot markets and up to 0.015% rebates for futures markets. This is the most generous rebates program across CEXes and DEXes so far.\n\tAlso, Gate.io reduced taker fees for certain VIP tiers to stimulate large-scale clients' trading activity.\n\tIn addition to its program for market makers, Gate.io adjusted the VIP10-VIP16 levels in its VIP status initiative. Namely, all accounts from the VIP10-VIP16 levels can now trade with 0% maker fees on the spot and futures dashboards of Gate.io.\n\tIn its attempt to guarantee the highest possible level of service for institutions, Gate.io unveiled Gate Institution which is an institutional investor services arm. The focus of this department is to strengthen the presence of Gate.io in the institution's digital assets trading segment and to provide industry-level support to sophisticated clients.\n\tWith Gate Institution, sophisticated traders can benefit from high-frequency and low-latency servers, enjoy discounts and premium offer for MM and VIP tiers, and access up to 100x leveraged trading, obtain secure funding and instant loans.\n\tElin, the head of Gate Institutional, highlights that this segment of the crypto audience is of crucial importance for Gate:\n\tMarket makers play a vital role in the markets, providing liquidity and stimulating growth. Our institutional services are tailored to reflect their importance. We remain confident that global market makers will experience the highest level of service and the most competitive offerings on Gate.io. We‚Äôre always looking for new ways to enhance our services to attract new investors.\n\tTo introduce new opportunities to market makers and sophisticated traders, the Gate.io team launched a massive trading competition with one of the largest prize pools in crypto. A total of $2 million in equivalent will be distributed between traders that would migrate from their existing platforms to Gate.io.\n\tTo be eligible for this tournament, traders will be required to provide ‚Äúproof of volume‚Äù; all eligible applicants will immediately see their VIP status upgraded.\n\tTop-tier cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem Gate.io reconsiders its fees structure to attract maximum liquidity inflows. Gate.io introduces market maker rebates of 0.012-0.015% for spot and derivatives sections. This is the most competitive rebate rate on the market by Q3 2022.\n\tAlso, Gate.io launches the competition for large-scale traders who migrate from other centralized exchanges with a $2,000,000 prize pool.\n",

    "content": "\tBitsgap, a cutting-edge platform for trading bots, invites all crypto owners to try a disruptive automated trading experience. Its instruments are suitable for both newcomers and experienced cryptocurrency traders.\n\tLaunched in 2017, Bitsgap is among the most popular and technically capable trading bots platform in the Web3 segment.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tIt adheres to an all-in-one approach to automated trading and prioritizes clear UX/UI and data security.\n\tAs such, Bitsgap offers an unmatched stack of opportunities for various categories of traders interested in removing the \"human factor\" from their trading and investing strategies.\n\tTrading bots are AI-powered software programs designed to automate the process of trading. Trading bots can optimize trading on foreign exchanges (Forex, FX), commodities, stocks, and cryptocurrency platforms. Simply put, these mechanisms are able to publish and cancel trading orders on behalf of users.\n\tTrading bots are becoming increasingly popular since they allow them to generate income without spending time and effort on analysis, tracking orders, etc. To activate a crypto trading bot, a trader needs to manually set up the details of its strategy and its \"style\" (aggressive, conservative) and integrate it with an account on this or that trading service.\n\tIn general, crypto trading bots are legit instruments. It is a subclass of trading software that can only remove the need for traders to manually control the entire process of interaction with orders. Trading bots can generate income alone; they also cannot be treated as a 100% safe haven amid a painful bearish recession.\n\tHowever, there are numerous services that introduce themselves as trading bots but are nothing but Ponzi schemes. As such, potential users should be very careful about the services that guarantee profits, offer obscure fee schemes (\"100% free for all users\"), or advertise breathtaking ROI for beginners.\n\tWhile choosing a crypto trading bot, traders should consider various aspects to find the one that best meets their requirements.\n\tAs such, traders should perform due diligence before choosing crypto trading bots for AI-powered deals.\n\tPopular trading bot platform Bitsgap offers a feature-rich toolkit for AI-powered trading. It allows cryptocurrency users with various levels of expertise in crypto to try automated trading with minimal risk and effort.\n\tGrid bot is the most newbie-friendly way to start your automated high-frequency trading journey. With grid bots, traders set up a \"grid\" by adding intervals to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Once the price of this or that crypto reaches the preset level, the bot either buys or sells the deposit (or its part) automatically.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tWith Bitsgap, users can choose between two beginner-level GRID bots (\"Flat\" and \"Buy the Dip\") and one advanced-level bot, \"Custom Grid.\" \"Flat\" bot is the classic version of GRID bots: it places a fixed order grid and gets rewards when the price fluctuates in a preset range.\n\t\"Buy the Dip\" is also a very easy-to-understand bot: it just purchases the currency every time it becomes cheaper. This suits long-term holders interested in increasing their Bitcoin (BTC) riches.\n\t\"Custom grid\" bot has a number of instruments to adjust its toolkit: traders can experiment with trailing modes, \"stop-loss\"/\"take-profit\" tooling, and so on.\n\t\"Dollar-—Åost Averaging,\" or DCA, is among the oldest regular investment strategies. Working with DCA, investors spend equal sums of basic currency to buy certain assets periodically. For instance, you can buy Bitcoin (BTC) for $1,000 monthly, regardless of its actual price. This strategy protects investors from price fluctuations and removes the necessity to guess about the precise \"top\" and \"bottom\" of the moment.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tBitsgap advances this battle-tested strategy: its users can leverage the most popular technical analysis indicator pairs (MACD+RSI and Stochastic+Channel) to upgrade DCA tactics and make it more profitable than ever before.\n\tAlso, with Bitsgap, users can work with the familiar \"Pure DCA\" bot to just make this strategy automated. Experienced traders can also set up \"Custom DCA\" with enhanced risk management tools and extra indicators.\n\tBesides a wide range of bots for spot accounts, Bitsgap also has COMBO futures trading bots that work with up to 10x leverage. Technically, Bitsgap‚Äôs COMBO futures trading bot is a combination of the grid and DCA trading techniques customized for crypto futures.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitsgap\n\tWith Bitsgap, both long and short futures trading bots are available. In \"Long\" mode, the bot makes a profit when the price goes upward or sideways. The bot opens a \"Buy\" position for half of the invested funds and places DCA orders for the remainder. Then, the position is closed incrementally via a series of grid orders. Once the position is fully closed, the instrument repeats the cycle.\n\tThe \"Short\" mode of the futures trading bot by Bitsgap works oppositely: it starts with the opening \"Sell\" position. Both modes are available for beginner users, as mentioned by Bitsgap's website.\n\tAlongside standard and advanced trading bot toolkits, Bitsgap offers its users the opportunity to place an enhanced range of orders in an automated manner. Bitsgap released \"Trading Terminal,\" a cloud-hosted platform for order placement and execution.\n\tThis module unlocks impressive opportunities for Bitsgap users: they can automate the placement of advanced orders (Limit, TWAP, Scaled, Market, Stop, and Stop-Limits) on all mainstream centralized crypto exchanges.\n\tThe terminal also offers Trailing Orders and One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO) orders to support complex trading strategies. Bitsgap terminal is integrated with TradingView, the largest website for traders globally. It allows the usage of dozens of indicators and gets credible cryptocurrency content from the curated news feed. Just like other products of the Bitsgap ecosystem, its trading terminal is connected to exchanges via APIs.\n\tTo ensure an unmatched trading experience for new users, Bitsgap introduced a seven-day free trial period on all of its services. Within the demo period, every new user can enjoy the functions available for paid tariffs, charged with zero fees. Nothing but an email address is required to verify one's account on Bitsgap, while registration via Google, Facebook, and Apple log-in tools are also available.\n\tThen, to spread the word about Bitsgap endeavors and introduce the exchange to a new generation of traders, the platform started a generous affiliate program. Every user of Bitsgap can get their affiliate link, share it in social media accounts and start earning a share of the referral revenue.\n\tFor advanced affiliates, the Bitsgap affiliate program is an incredibly powerful tool that can significantly increase revenue from their current referral base. As an affiliate of top exchanges like ByBit, Binance, or Gemini, earnings are typically based on the number of trades, and trading volume made by referred clients. By using bots, referrals can make significantly more trades and trading volume while earning profits regardless of market conditions. This helps to retain clients on the exchange and multiplies the current referral income for the affiliate. It also means that the affiliate will be getting commissions from both sides: from Bitsgap, and the crypto exchange like ByBit, for instance.\n\tBitsgap is a multi-product ecosystem of cryptocurrency trading bots. It offers GRID trading bots, DCA bots, and COMBO futures bots that can be integrated via APIs with mainstream centralized exchanges (CEXes).\n\tBitsgap supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and all major altcoins. Users can automate their strategies and benefit from affiliate programs.\n",

    "content": "\tAs crypto markets are still trapped in a bearish recession, blockchain enthusiasts, traders, and liquidity providers are aggressively looking for new earning opportunities. Zephyr, a new-gen prediction market platform, allows them to profit even when ‚Äúthere is blood on the street.‚Äù\n\tLaunched in 2022 by a reputable team of blockchain enthusiasts, the Zephyr crypto prediction market is set to introduce the amazing opportunities of Web3 and AI to the thriving space of crypto trading, liquidity management, and forecasts.\n\tHere‚Äôs why Zephyr‚Äôs stack of services looks unique in 2022:\n\tSimply put, Zephyr unveiled a new-gen mechanism for the crypto price prediction market to unlock new opportunities for digital asset holders with various levels of expertise.\n\tPrediction markets or PMs should be referred to as a class of open markets where specific outcomes can be predicted using financial incentives. In other words, this type of market allows its participants to monetize their forecasts about some events in the future.\n\tPM prices indicate the ‚Äúcrowd opinion‚Äù about the probability of this or that event. As such, one could witness impressive gains should one make a successful bet on an event the majority of people cannot predict.\n\tPrediction markets (also known as betting markets, information markets, decision markets, or idea futures) have been popular since the 16th century. Since the early 2000s, traders can bet on events via the Internet.\n\tIt is the easiest way to capitalize on your expertise in almost anything, from politics and economics to weather, climate change, and social life. Unlike trading, betting on PMs does not require special technical or operational skills.\n\tPlacing a bet on prediction markets is way easier technically than trading spots and futures positions on foreign exchanges (FX), stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrency markets.\n\tAlso, most PMs work in a low-cost manner, within reasonable trading limits, and do not implement strict KYC/AML checks.\n\tIn 2018, with the inception of Augur, the first-ever fully decentralized on-chain prediction market on Ethereum (ETH), the history of PMs on blockchain started. First-gen crypto prediction markets like Omen and Gnosis introduced smart contracts to the sphere of betting on the outcomes of various events.\n\tBeing fully decentralized, non-custodial, transparent technical systems, blockchains provide an ideal technical basis for PMs: nobody can cheat on betting organized through an ecosystem of smart contracts.\n\tAlso, the ability of crypto PMs to seamlessly integrate with non-custodial digital asset wallets eliminates the need for software downloads, registration, and verification procedures. The prices of digital assets themselves are a perfect example of an event suitable for setting up prediction markets.\n\tLaunched on the mainnet in Q3, 2022, Zephyr is a cutting-edge, high-performance ecosystem of prediction markets for cryptocurrency users.\n\tZephyr is a service that allows users to benefit from forecasting cryptocurrency prices. It tracks the price fluctuations of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and a number of other cryptocurrencies.\n\tWhile betting on price fluctuation, every user of Zephyr can either work with the existing PM pool (actually, a market based on the direction of price movement demonstrated by this or that asset) or set up their own PM. Users can inject either 5 or 10 USDZ into a pool associated with a cryptocurrency asset (50 and 100 USDZ pools are coming soon).\n\tAll the contributions of users are equal in the corresponding pool. Once the event takes place, the rewards are distributed according to the accuracy of their prediction. The winner gets his bet doubled; people can make more than one bet in one pool. In total, a user can invest even $50 in a $10 pool with 5 different parts. Zephyr‚Äôs reward algorithm is unique enabling 60% of the pool participants to become winners.\n\tTo start using Zephyr, a newcomer should set up an account via email or log in with their non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, like MetaMask.\n\tWorking with Zephyr demonstrates many opportunities compared to classic crypto trading, betting, and PM services. To start with, it is one of the exclusive opportunities to profit from a bearish recession: with Zephyr, traders only need volatility to benefit from the forecast.\n\tAs such, it works not unlike trading futures ‚Äî but with reduced risks and a more streamlined technical procedure. Also, it does not charge betting with high commissions, while its operations do not depend on gas price dynamics. Zephyr‚Äôs clients only pay negligible 1% commission.\n\tBetting on Zephyr‚Äôs PMs does not require sophisticated education and specific market expertise: traders can just follow their favorite influencers and most experienced forecasters. This case study is a perfect example.\n\tUnder the hood, Zephyr has a dashboard where cryptocurrency enthusiasts can bet on the direction of price movement for this or that asset. PMs with 12-hour and 24-hour expiration periods are available in presets.\n\tThen, Zephyr users can launch their own prediction markets with a high range of expiration dates available (up to one year).\n\tTo make the process of using PMs more transparent and accessible to newbies, its creators deployed two leaderboards demonstrating the rankings of ‚Äúmost valuable players‚Äù or MVPs of the week and month. All traders displayed in MVP lists have traceable Ethereum (ETH) addresses so visitors can verify their trading history.\n\tIn order to advance the understanding of cryptocurrency markets, Zephyr users can try the Opinion Leader module. This unique instrument tracks the statements and price predictions and of seasoned cryptocurrency experts - entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, analysts. Then, the tool analyzes the overall forecast performance of the opinion leaders to count their accuracy score.\n\tZephyr aggregates top opinions across various social media platforms and blog resources. As a result, now, the crypto community can clearly determine whose opinion is worthy and whose is misleading, and then, follow only trustable influencers.\n\tTo support new traders, Zephyr introduced a massive bonus campaign. All bonuses are distributed between the participants in USDZ equivalents and, therefore, can be used while betting on PMs immediately.\n\tZephyr introduces three types of bonuses: Welcome Bonus, Deposit Bonus, and Referral Program Bonus:\n\tAlso, to let its users benefit from simply locking liquidity into the pools, Zephyr introduced Zephyr Earn, a DeFi-era liquidity initiative. It can serve as an income stream for long-term cryptocurrency holders. Zephyr Earn accepts liquidity and distributes periodical payouts between its donors.\n\tZephyr is an ecosystem of cryptocurrency prediction markets. It allows crypto users to benefit from correct forecasts on cryptocurrency prices. Zephyr works with various cryptocurrencies and accepts bets in the native asset USDZ.\n\tAs such, betting on Zephyr is beneficial even amid a general recession in cryptocurrency markets. For crypto newbies, the platform introduced a massive bonus initiative and referral program.\n",

    "content": "\tGate.io, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem, announces the release of the ZK-powered mechanism for the proof-of-reserves procedure. Being a fully open-source tool, the new scheme guarantees an industry-leading level of transparency for Gate.io traders.\n\tStarting from November 2023, customers of the Gate.io crypto exchange can check the platform's reserves using the ZK-powered proof-of-reserve mechanism.\n\tGate.io pioneered the concept of the proof-of-reserves (PoR) procedure in 2020 by enlisting a third-party auditor to verify exchange wallets, compile user balance data in a Merkle tree and publish anonymized data in encrypted form. Since the new procedure is 100% open source, everyone can audit novel development and check its stability and credibility.\n\tLaunched in 2013 by Dr. Lin Han, Gate.io is one of the world's longest-running cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges based on liquidity and trading volume on CoinGecko, the largest independent crypto segment tracker.\n\tIn all, the exchange delivers its services to 13 million users across dozens of countries on all continents. Gate.io launchpad services unlocked fundraising opportunities for a plethora of early stage services. Also, in Q4, 2023, the exchange unveiled its multiproduct noncustodial platform for crypto storage and conversion, dubbed Gate.io Web3.\n\tProof of reserves is a protocol in the cryptocurrency world used by exchanges and custodians to verify that they possess enough assets to cover customer balances. This process is crucial for transparency and trust, as it assures users that their funds are safely held and can be withdrawn when needed.\n\tIn proof of reserves, a third-party auditor typically examines the company's digital wallet addresses and balances, comparing them against user balances to ensure adequacy. The method often involves cryptographic techniques, allowing the auditor to validate the holdings without revealing sensitive customer information.\n\tProof of reserves gained importance in 2022 following the FTX collapse and the bankruptcies of Voyager, Celsius and Three Arrows Capital. By providing a verifiable way to confirm asset holdings, proof of reserves helps to build user confidence, reduce the risk of insolvency and promote ethical practices within the cryptocurrency sector.\n\tzk-SNARKs, or \"Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge,\" are a form of cryptographic proof technology. They enable one party to prove to another that they know a value or possess certain information, without revealing the information itself or interacting with the other party beyond the initial proof. This technology is fundamental in enhancing privacy in blockchain transactions.\n\tIn the context of cryptocurrencies like Zcash, zk-SNARKs allow transactions to be fully encrypted on the blockchain while still being verified as valid under the network's consensus rules. This is achieved through sophisticated mathematical techniques that provide a way to ascertain the legitimacy of a transaction without exposing details such as the sender, receiver or transaction amount.\n\tzk-SNARKs are crucial for privacy-focused blockchain applications because they offer strong assurances of data integrity and security without compromising confidentiality. Their implementation, however, is complex and requires a deep understanding of advanced cryptography.\n\tTop crypto exchange Gate.io enhanced its proof-of-reserves (PoR) system with zk-SNARKs to guarantee maximum transparency with zero anonymity and security trade-offs.\n\tPer the official statement of its team, crypto exchange ecosystem Gate.io implemented a major upgrade to its proof-of-reserves (PoR) procedure. Now it is secured by zk-SNARKs, a cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology.\n\tüöÄ #Gateio's Proof of Reserves (PoR) just got a major upgrade üîÑ Introducing zero-knowledge tech for enhanced transparency, security, and privacy üîçGateio's surplus amount is higher than users' deposit üíº Learn More: https://t.co/XkynOu2OHd pic.twitter.com/Hh2Rhr5cu3\n\tSince 2020, the exchange broadcasted the indexed and encrypted data about its reserves in the form of a Merkle tree, a data structure in cryptography and computer science, used for efficiently summarizing and verifying large sets of data. At the same time, after the collapses of 2022 that resulted in the billion-dollar losses of traders and investors, Gate.io decided to prepare an upgrade to this mechanism:\n\tWhile this method does provide security, privacy, and independent verification, it was identified that there was still room for improvement.\n\tAs a result, in November, 2023, Gate.io replaced the previous-gen proof-of-reserves mechanism with a new one that employs zk-SNARKs.\n\tFirst of all, implementing zk-SNARKs addresses concerns about the previous method, which left open the possibility of including fabricated accounts with negative balances to alter the data. Theoretically, the exchange had the opportunity to cheat by manipulating the data before broadcasting them to the Merkle tree. With the upgrade activated, Gate.io's proof-of-reserves (PoR) procedure works for 100+ major cryptocurrencies available on the platform.\n\tProof-of-reserve certificates are constantly updated and published on special web pages within the platform. Users can independently verify the results by themselves even without specific expertise in blockchain and cryptography technologies. In order to meet the diverse needs of users in an ever-evolving market, Gate.io will regularly evaluate the market and gradually increase supported currencies.\n\tWhile building and activating the new mechanism, Gate.io exchange kept in mind the following enhancements for users:\n\tThe new proof-of-reserves procedure by Gate.io is 100% open source: everyone can check its technical design in the \"gate-zkmerkle-proof\" folder of Gate.io's GateChain repository on GitHub platform (MySQL database management system is required).\n\tFor all cryptocurrency enthusiasts with no tech expertise, all necessary information about how zk-SNARKs improve Gate.io's PoR will be published on the Gate Learn portal.\n\tIn November 2023, cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io activated a novel mechanism for its proof-of-reserves (PoR) procedure. Now it relies on zk-SNARKs, a cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology. Everyone can challenge the PoR data by themselves and verify their credibility, even without cryptography expertise.\n\tWith the new upgrade, Gate.io's proof of reserves became more accurate, tamper-proof, comprehensive and cost-effective. By press time, Gate.io reserves exceed user funds' value by over $437 million, the volume of reserves exceeded the net amount of Gate.io wallets by over 15.6%, cryptographically verified data says.\n",

    "content": "\tXRP may finally be on the brink of a recovery since the price had established a foothold above the 50-EMA resistance level of the asset. With that being said, there is the chance for a further breakthrough; however, in one way or another, it lacks momentum.\n\tXRP price market outlook: Currently, the price action of XRP has found a lot of promise in recovery after the break above the 50-day exponential moving average. This move showed a changing market sentiment given that the 50 EMA will most probably determine whether XRP is in a short-run uptrend or downtrend. These are bullish steps but with stiff hurdles above $0.55 and $0.60.\n\tThe RSI is above the neutral level of 50, suggesting that there is no specific strong buying or selling pressure taking place around this area. In a state like this, the RSI means that the recent gains are welcome but without robust momentum to confirm a sustained uptrend.\n\tOverall, the market sentiment for XRP can be regarded as cautiously optimistic. Investors are waiting for much-needed buying interest to confirm the strengthening of the uptrend. The trading volume at current trading positions is also somewhat stable, but not enough.\n\tLuckily for the market, Shiba Inu has been able to withstand the selling pressure and did not fall below the 50 EMA. But at the same time, the momentum is not there, and SHIB really needs way more support to break through.\n\tShiba Inu has found a crucial support level at the 50-day EMA, which has helped prevent further declines. This support has been vital in maintaining SHIB's price stability in recent trading sessions. The 50 EMA acts as a lifesaver, keeping the asset afloat amid increasing selling pressure.\n\t\n\t\n\tRecent whale transactions indicate heightened activity among large holders of SHIB. Over the past 24 hours, there have been 147 large transactions totaling 1.9 trillion SHIB. This surge in transaction volume suggests that big players are still engaged, possibly redistributing their holdings or preparing for potential market moves. However, this activity has yet to translate into significant upward price movement, as market momentum remains subdued.\n\tDespite the support at the 50 EMA, SHIB's price has not shown strong bullish momentum. The RSI remains relatively neutral, indicating a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. For SHIB to break through current resistance levels and initiate a more substantial upward trend, it needs more robust market support and increased buying interest.\n\tAnd that is, Ethereum is eyeing $4,000 either on its latest price performance or bears' failure to sink the value of the asset below the $3,700 mark. But the good news is that the price looks to avoid a blow-off.\n\tEthereum has recently withstood the greatest surge, vibes taking its price toward the $4,000 level. The latest outbreak above $3,700 leaves a beautiful site with new support, signaling that there is major buying interest. The 50-day EMA, superiorly moving with the price action, would strengthen the bullish picture. In the meantime, the RSI is trading around 70, suggesting at this juncture that ETH is overbought but remains strong.\n\t\n\t\n\tFor a move higher, Ethereum must remain over its key support at $3,700. The next key resistance level is forming near $3,850. With this, the pair clears the path to $4,000 and eventually eyes maximum resistance, which, as of now, may come during the coming sessions. On the downside, solid support is pegged at the $3,500 level, and any move below it could trigger a short-term bearish trend.\n\tOverall, the forward-looking future for Ethereum remains upwardly skewed. The bullish run should persist, provided the market keeps the bullish momentum.\n",

    "content": "\tDespite more and more cryptocurrencies moving to alternative consensus models, cryptocurrency mining remains a legitimate and relevant opportunity for blockchain business in 2024.\n\tViaBTC, a highly reputable all-in-one service, is changing the way the industry perceives mining in 2024 and lowering barriers to entry for newcomers. Also, its novel revenue models pave the way to more inclusive and fair profit-sharing.\n\tInitially introduced in 2016 as a Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool, ViaBTC has evolved into a full-stack cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\tAs such, ViaBTC merges the benefits of the best PoW mining pool practices with the novelties of the DeFi epoch in Web3.\n\tCryptocurrency mining is the process of new unit creation and transaction verification on blockchain networks. It involves using computer power to solve complex mathematical puzzles. When these puzzles are solved, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\n\tThis process requires substantial computational power and electricity, as the puzzles have become increasingly difficult over time. Miners often use specialized hardware, including GPUs and ASICs, to optimize their mining efficiency.\n\tIn terms of business, mining should be considered as offering specific hardware for maintaining the integrity of blockchains in order to get rewards in some blockchain‚Äôs currency.\n\tProof of work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism (agreement between multiple elements) used by some blockchain networks, most notably Bitcoin (BTC) and its forks, to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\tIn PoW, miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles using computational power. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets the right to add a new block to the blockchain and is able to grab a mining reward.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis process ensures network security and integrity, as altering any block would require redoing the work of that block and all subsequent blocks, which is computationally irrational.\n\tFor the first time, cryptocurrency mining went mainstream amids the 2016-2017 bull run of Bitcoin (BTC). During the two Crypto Winters that occurred in 2018-2020 and 2022-2023, interest in crypto mining reduced. As such, we need to consider both positive and negative catalysts for the crypto mining segment in 2024.\n\tNevertheless, in 2024, cryptocurrency mining shows no signs of becoming irrelevant. The sphere continues to flourish in an elaborated legal context and is fueled by advanced hardware components.\n\tIn recent years, numerous cryptocurrencies have decided to replace proof of work with more energy-efficient types of consensus. Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) migration toward proof of stake (PoS) is a textbook example.\n\tHowever, we can identify some groups of cryptocurrencies that can still be mined on PoW equipment.\n\tCryptocurrencies\n\tTickers\n\tMining algorithm\n\t1\n\tBitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Cash ABC\n\tBTC, BCH, XEC\n\tSHA-256d\n\t2\n\tEthereum Classic\n\tETC\n\tETCHASH\n\t3\n\tZCash, Horizen\n\tZEC, ZEN\n\tEquihash\n\tMining pools, i.e., entities responsible for coordination of computational power, remain go-to methods for enthusiasts of these cryptos.\n\tWith its unmatched expertise and holistic approach, ViaBTC offers a wide range of solutions for mining and other cryptocurrency services. ViaBTC mining pool is one of the largest and most influential entities in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) mining segments.\n\tLaunched on June 5, 2016, ViaBTC is among the oldest and most reputable cryptocurrency mining ecosystems in the entire industry. It delivers various services for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, but mining pool business remains its primary focus and the backbone element of its platform.\n\tViaBTC pools support mining of various proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies that work on top of almost all mainstream mining algorithms. That said, it supports Bitcoin (BTC) mining, together with its forks Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (XEC); all three are SHA-256d cryptocurrencies.\n\tIn addition, it supports Scrypt-based Bitcoin fork Litecoin (LTC); ViaBTC is by far the largest Litecoin (LTC) miner in existence. Its dominance in this segment has been undisputed for years.\n\tBesides mainstream cryptos, ViaBTC supports the mining of niche altcoins such as privacy coin ZCash (ZEC), hybrid cryptos Dash (DASH) and Horizen (ZEN), new-gen PoW cryptocurrencies Nervos Network (CKB) and Kaspa (KAS), as well as Ethereum Classic (ETC), an original version of the Ethereum (ETH) protocol.\n\tThe full list of assets supported is published on ViaBTC‚Äôs main webpage.\n\tUnlike the majority of its rivals, ViaBTC supports hourly profit settlement for mining, providing automatic withdrawal and exchange functions. Miners can quickly process their assets, reducing losses due to market fluctuations, even in extreme market conditions.\n\tViaBTC introduced a mining revenue-sharing tool, allowing miners to proportionally distribute their mining income to mining pool operators or partners, creating an efficient and transparent revenue-sharing model.\n\tIn its operations, ViaBTC offers clients the three most popular schemes for profit calculations, namely, PPS+, PPLNS and SOLO. While the PPS+ design is preset as the default one, every scheme has its own benefits and, therefore, caters to a particular group of miners. Every enthusiast is able to find a fitting scheme with ViaBTC.\n\tViaBTC pioneered the concept of smart mining for its most popular BTC, BCH, ZEN and ZEC mining pools. Users can easily switch between mining currencies with a single click and can automatically switch their hashrate to mine more profitable currencies based on real-time mining income.\n\tViaBTC offers unique industry advantages, enabling the withdrawal of mining assets to CoinEx exchange with zero fees.\n\tAlso, for some cryptocurrencies, additional bonuses can be claimed alongside cryptocurrencies from mining rewards. Namely, for mining one Bitcoin (BTC) block, you can grab an extra bonus of 1 NMC, 5 SYS or 0.4 ELA; in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) pool, 1 SYS is set as an extra reward.\n\tIn ViaBTC‚Äôs premium product ‚Äî the Litecoin (LTC) pool ‚Äî customers can also mine Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market capitalization and the most popular cryptocurrency in this segment. DOGE rewards are settled in the PPLNS method.\n\tBuilding an industry-leading product, ViaBTC attempts to consider the requirements of various customer segments. For instance, large-scale investors interested in purchasing extra hashrate for maximum rewards are invited to apply for VIP Hashrate mode.\n\tThe platform employs a high-standard, multilevel risk control system, while its mining nodes are deployed all over the world for the lowest possible latency. To make income strategies predictable, ViaBTC developed seamless mining calculators and crypto conversion tooling.\n\tViaBTC is seamlessly integrated with CoinEx, one of the fastest growing centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and with its open-source EVM blockchain, CoinEx Chain. Auto-withdrawal instruments and transaction accelerators are also designed to make cryptocurrency mining more efficient than ever before.\n\tTo sum up, ViaBTC is a Tier 1 cryptocurrency mining ecosystem for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Its variety of revenue sharing schemes is designed to achieve the highest possible income for investors with no regard to their deposit size and previous backgrounds.\n\tIn 2024, ViaBTC is poised to be a newbie-friendly and easy-to-join gateway to the cryptocurrency mining business for newcomers and professionals in Web3. Customers are invited to join a limited ViaBTC referral campaign and enjoy periodical rewards.\n",

    "content": "\tAmid the ongoing bearish recession, traders, investors and DeFi enthusiasts are looking for newbie-friendly ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù opportunities for decentralized crypto trading and ‚Äúyield farming.‚Äù\n\tBacked by Tier 1 CeDeFi ecosystem Nominex (NMX), novel decentralized crypto exchange Nomiswap with its automated market making (AMM) instrument is set to push the barriers for professional traders, liquidity providers and Web3 newbies.\n\tLaunched in January 2022, Nomiswap DEX addresses all major bottlenecks in the turbulent segment of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange with AMMs. It melds the one-click DEX with a multi-asset ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù dashboard.\n\tNomiswap allows its users to exchange assets on BNB Chain (BSC) among each other and to provide liquidity to obtain periodic payouts on their assets.\n\tSo, what is special about Nomiswap and its DEX tooling?\n\tAs such, Nomiswap, with its feature-rich toolkit and solid Nominex ecosystem backing, is setting new benchmarks in the AMM-powered DEXes segment.\n\tDecentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, or DEXes, should be considered a type of platform for cross-asset conversion of digital assets (cryptocurrency tokens) that does not include centralized storage and governance mechanisms.\n\tDecentralized exchanges are also called ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù exchanges: all their operations are executed directly in blockchains removing the need for centralized mediums. While on centralized exchanges, people trade ‚Äúagainst‚Äù centralized trading engines; on decentralized ones, orders are executed by automated market making instruments, or AMM.\n\tAMM leverages liquidity provided by users themselves; that is why decentralized exchanges are manipulation-resistant and have much stronger protection from attacks. Uniswap is the most popular DEX on Ethereum, while PancakeSwap (CAKE) is the largest BNB Chain‚Äôs DEX.\n\t‚ÄúYield farming‚Äù is a practice of obtaining periodic rewards for providing liquidity. Typically, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges attract liquidity from liquidity providers in the form of tokens needed for a platform‚Äôs operations.\n\tFor instance, to ‚Äúfarm yield‚Äù on BNB-USDT liquidity pool, Web3 enthusiasts should lock their liquidity in Binance Coins (BNB) and U.S. Dollar Tethers (USDT). The majority of pools accept liquidity in two assets; however, one-, three- and even four-asset pools are also available.\n\tTechnically, ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù works not unlike bank deposits: DEXes distribute a portion of their trading fees between their ‚Äúdonors.‚Äù Some protocols also distribute its native tokens as an additional incentive to provide liquidity. However, APRs on trending pairs can exceed 100-150%. ‚ÄúYield farming‚Äù on stablecoins, typically, is rewarded with 10-15% in APR.\n\tDeveloped by a heavy-hitting team of Web3 professionals, Nomiswap exchange melds the instruments of a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a newbie-friendly ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù dashboard.\n\tNomiswap‚Äôs ecosystem boasts a one-click swap module, liquidity provision (LP) toolkit, a number of ‚Äúfarms‚Äù (they allow LPs to inject liquidity into various assets to get rewards in NMX, a core native asset of Nominex ecosystem) and so on.\n\tAlso, in the ‚ÄúLaunchpools‚Äù segment, Nomiswap users can stake their NMX tokens to get rewards.\n\tIts multi-level referral program allows users to monetize their social media influence and start earning NMX tokens for every friend invited to the platform.\n\tNomiswap‚Äôs codebase and smart contracts architecture are audited by highly reputable third-party tech audit provider CertiK.\n\tFirst and foremost, Nomiswap DEX launched to offer secure KYC-agnostic trading and exchange instruments on the BNB Chain (BSC). As such, it supports a variety of assets issued on BSC, including PoS coins, stablecoins, native tokens of DeFi protocols and so on.\n\tAs Nomiswap DEX has no registration/verification procedure, it works with third-party noncustodial wallets for EVM-compatible blockchains. To start using Nomiswap, the user should just authorize his/her Metamask,TrustWallet or other compatible wallets, save seed phrases, connect the new wallet to Nomiswap and start trading.\n\tTrading operations are charged with a 0.1% fee - which is the lowest level on the market. Out of this sum, 0.03% is returned to liquidity providers while 0.07% is used for referral program rewards, trading fees cashback, NMX burning and Nomiswap profits.\n\tBesides trading, DeFi enthusiasts can lock their liquidity in Nomiswap‚Äôs yield farming module. In the ‚ÄúLiquidity‚Äù dashboard, traders can choose two assets to be used for liquidity providing activity; 37 token pairs are available by Q3, 2022. NMX-USDC and NMX-BUSD are the three most rewarding pools with over 70% in APR.\n\tAlso, in the ‚ÄúFarms‚Äù section, crypto holders can choose one of the hottest ‚Äúfarms‚Äù to earn yield in the form of NMX tokens.\n\tActual size of user rewards depends on his/her farming level. Farming level can be obtained by placing money into pools with ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô tag.\n\tFarming level\n\tSTARTER\n\tPARTNER\n\tPRO\n\tVIP\n\tELITE\n\tMAX\n\tUSD value\n\t<100\n\t100\n\t300\n\t1000\n\t5000\n\t10000\n\t‚ÄúFarms‚Äù users are eligible for lucrative rewards: they can participate in incentivized Team Farming programs in order to get 100 percent cashback, own farming/trading rewards and team farming/trading rewards (see below)\n\tAlso, Nomiswap users can get a ‚ÄúHolder Bonus‚Äù for unstoppable farming. ‚ÄúHolder Bonus‚Äù program can give users a 10x boost; it is paid out of 20 percent of the NMX daily distribution pool.\n\tLast but not least, the ‚ÄúLaunchpools‚Äù segment is the most resource-efficient way to farm yield on Nomiswap: traders can lock their NMX to get periodic rewards.\n\tNomiswap‚Äôs referral program allows every user to benefit from his/her audience on social media platforms. Once the user joins the referral program, he/she can earn 5-10% from the amount of NMX farmed by his/her own referrals, depending on the farming level.\n\tAlso, in the ‚ÄúTeam Farming‚Äù rewards program, traders can earn 5-10% from the total amount of NMX farmed by the ‚Äúweak‚Äù team (the branch of the referral tree with lower farming volume) depending on the farming level.\n\tTrading rewards include 10-20 per cent from the trading expenses of the own referrals depending on the farming level plus 5-10 percent from the total trading expenses conducted by the weak team\n\tNomiswap‚Äôs referral platform is a multi-level one; each member has two places at the first level, four places at the second level and so on.\n\tThe tokenomic design of Nomiswap (just like that of Nominex) is underpinned by its core native utility and governance asset, NMX. NMX‚Äôs circulating supply is capped at 200,000,000 tokens.\n\tNot unlike Binance‚Äôs BNB, NMX tokens can be used for paying trading fees with a 50% discount for trading on Nominex CeDeFi.\n\tAlso, NMX tokens can be staked in an isolated Nomiswap pool with over 70% in APR.\n\tLaunched in January 2022 by leading CeDeFi Nominex, Nomiswap (NMX) DEX with AMM unlocks more profitable trading and yield farming opportunities for Web3 professionals and newbies globally. It allows noncustodial conversion of cryptocurrency assets on BNB Chain (BSC) and multi-product yield farming - for NMX-based pairs, for NMX tokens, and for 37 BSC-based pairs.\n\tThe protocol has the lowest possible trading fees of 0.1%; this amount can be subsidized through 100% cashback in NMX tokens.\n\tNomiswap introduces a multi-level referral program with lucrative rewards for participants with various levels of expertise in crypto and blockchain.\n",

This combination has enabled BTSE to evolve into a go-to crypto futures trading platform for millions of users from all over the globe.\n\tLaunched in 2018, BTSE is a cryptocurrency futures trading platform. It facilitates the secure and anonymous exchange of Bitcoin (BTC), U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and over 130+ cryptocurrencies.. Originally founded by an elite team of Wall Street traders and programmers, the company champions a \"technology first\" approach. Today, under the leadership of CEO Henry Liu and COO Jeff Mei, BTSE is being steered towards new horizons.\n\t\n\tImage by BTSE\n\tApart from operating as a trading platform for end users, BTSE operates a B2B arm, BTSE Enterprise Solutions, that offers white label blockchain solutions for companies seeking to roll out their own crypto exchanges.\n\tThe platform's innovative nature has not gone unnoticed: the exchange received the prestigious 2022 Best Crypto Trading Technology award by Entrepreneur.com.\n\tBTSE is available as a web interface and also via mobile app for iOS and Android-based smartphone devices.\n\tBTSE's feature-rich and high-performance futures trading platform is a core element in the BTSE ecosystem. Thanks to its cutting-edge tech and infrastructure, the platform supports up to one million trades per second. Because all of its systems are developed and hosted in house, BTSE boasts a solid track record of zero downtime since its founding. BTSE was the first mainstream trading platform to offer its customers an all-in-one multi-currency order book, meaning that liquidity for different trading pairs for a particular base currency is combined, i.e. orders for BTC/USD and BTC/JPY are combined into one book. As a result, BTSE offers far deeper liquidity when compared to exchanges which use order books based solely on one currency.\n\t\n\tImage by BTSE\n\tThe platform offers advanced charting tools for seasoned traders and sophisticated order types: time-weighted average price (TWAP) orders, one-cancels-the-other (OCO) orders, algorithmic index orders, hidden orders etc. To make futures trading predictable and frictionless, BTSE implemented automated and customizable margin call notifications. Customizable alerts are designed to mitigate the liquidations for BTSE traders. Also, the exchange pioneered multi-asset collateral and settlement, making for a more fluid trading experience.\n\tTo enhance flexibility and risk control, BTSE offers a maximum 100x leverage for futures trades.\n\tCryptocurrency staking has gained traction as one of the most reliable and newbie-friendly ways for earning passive income in crypto. With staking, the user just locks his or her tokens and obtains periodic rewards proportional to the amount of funds locked.\n\tWith BTSE Earn, an easy-to-use cryptocurrency staking dashboard, users can inject their liquidity into fixed and flexible staking programs. In the fixed savings module, users are invited to lock USDT with 9% APY, and Bitcoin (BTC) with 2.75% APY; staking altcoins on BTSE offers yields of up to 37%. Seven (7-), 14-, 30-, 60- and 90-day staking programs are available for BTSE users.\n\t\n\tImage by BTSE\n\tAlso, in a flexible savings program, users can stake USDT at an APY of 7% with the opportunity to redeem their stakes at any moment without losing rewards, as interest is awarded and compounded daily. Last but not least, in BTSE‚Äôs Lending module, users can earn interest by lending fiat-pegged assets (wHKD, wUSD, wEUR and so on) to the BTSE capital pool.\n\tSince the early days of its operations, BTSE has been focused on regulatory compliance to protect user funds. As of Q2, 2023, the platform is licensed in Lithuania and Liechtenstein, both European countries that are among the key global fintech hubs. A number of license applications are pending for BTSE in Europe and Asia.\n\tIn the coming months, the exchange is set to release the BTSE Card. This will be a full-fledged debit card with support for deposits in Euro (EUR) With this strategic offering, BTSE will be able to offer its users a convenient and reliable channel for crypto-to-fiat conversion.\n\tBesides its impressive toolkit for end users (both corporate and retail traders), BTSE runs a B2B unit named BTSE Enterprise Solutions, which is focused on building white label solutions for crypto entrepreneurs.\n\tWith BTSE‚Äôs white label solutions, developers do not need to build their cryptocurrency exchanges from scratch. They can instead take BTSE‚Äôs battle-tested technology and customize it to the needs of their respective business strategies to launch their offerings more quickly.\n\tWith this offering, BTSE can streamline the development process for novel crypto services to optimize resource efficiency. BTSE Enterprise Solutions also supports its customers in areas where technical and marketing expertise are required.\n\tBoutique cryptocurrency exchange BTSE guarantees low-fees, secure and fast futures trading for traders across various trading literacy levels. Its staking, lending and saving programs allow crypto users to benefit from their deposits, offering APYs of up to 9% on stablecoins, 2.85% on Bitcoin (BTC) and 37% on altcoins.\n\tIt will be interesting to see what else this tech-focused boutique crypto exchange rolls out in the near future. Crypto enthusiasts can check out BTSE website, follow the platform in Telegram and Twitter, join the discussions in Discord and track its content on YouTube.\n",

    "title": "Helio Protocol Addresses Centralization Risks With Its Destablecoin, HAY: Review",
    "time": "2023-03-06",
    "author": "Vladislav Sopov",
    "content": "\tHelio Protocol reinvents the concept of stablecoins with its HAY destablecoin. Its architecture is aimed at eliminating all major risks associated with collateralization and centralized control over stablecoin issuance.\n\tPublicly launched in Q3, 2022, Helio Protocol develops HAY, the first-ever decentralized, overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin backed by Binance Coin (BNB), the fourth largest stablecoin by market capitalization.\n\tFrom TerraUSD (UST) and Fei (FEI) to HUSD and Neutrino USD (USDN), a number of stablecoins collapsed painfully in 2022. HAY combines the best practices in the industry and employs innovative approaches to address weaknesses demonstrated by its predecessors.\n\tStable cryptocurrencies, or stablecoins, are digital (blockchain-based) assets with prices pegged to an underlying fiat currency or commodity. Typically, stablecoins are pegged to major world reserve currencies (U.S. Dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Offshore Renminbi) or precious metals (Gold and Silver).\n\tLaunched in 2014 on then-new blockchain BitShares (BTS), USD-pegged stablecoin BitUSD was the first cryptocurrency of this type. Aggregated capitalization of all major stablecoins peaked in May 2022: before the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem, it had stayed at almost $190 billion in equivalent.\n\tAs of February 2023, this indicator sits at $136.2 billion. U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) are three dominant stablecoins; in all, they are responsible for over 95% of the segment.\n\tStablecoins went mainstream as they can be used for value transfer, a medium of exchange and as money storage instruments. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, they are not volatile, while they retain the same accessibility, liquidity and operability as other cryptocurrencies. Major analysts noticed that stablecoins are used by traders to \"park\" their money during times of bearish recession.\n\tAs such, the increase in the stablecoins cap is always interpreted as an indicator of an upcoming bullish rally.\n\tIn general, all stablecoins can be divided into two large groups, i.e., centralized and decentralized stablecoins. With centralized stablecoins, the process of minting (issuance) of new assets is 100% controlled by the centralized entity behind the stablecoin. For instance, Tether decides on whether the supply of U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) should be increased or reduced, Circle does the same for USD Coin and so on. Also, the centralized issuer is the only entity that controls the basket of assets every stablecoin is backed by. Typically, to ensure that every stablecoin is backed by reserves, the issuers create a portfolio of cash, commercial paper, treasuries and so on.\n\tDecentralized stablecoins work differently: the balance between the reserves and circulating supply is controlled by the programmatic design of smart contracts. As such, this design automatically reduces the supply of the stablecoin when its price drops below the peg and increases when it surges over the peg. Decentralized stablecoins, therefore, are more flexible and censorship resistant; however, centralized ones are easier to manage.\n\tDeveloped by Helio Protocol, HAY is a novel decentralized stablecoin (destablecoin) that employs the most reliable concepts of DeFi: liquid staking, overcollateralization and so on.\n\tIntroduced in August 2022 amid a crypto winter, HAY by Helio Protocol attempts to address all roadblocks in the stablecoin segment. HAY is a decentralized stablecoin issued on the top of BNB Smart Chain (previously Binance Smart Chain, or BSC); this blockchain was chosen due to its low fees, high operational speed and EVM-compatibility. HAY is backed by Binance Coins (BNB); to mint and get some HAY, users need to pledge Binance Coins (BNB) as collateral.\n\tThe platform works with a safe \"loan-to-value\" ratio of 66%; to get 66 HAY, users should collateralize $100 in Binance Coin (BNB) equivalent. In total, HAY‚Äôs mint cap will never exceed 5% of Binance Coin's (BNB) market capitalization. Such limits are imposed to allow the Helio Protocol team to protect HAY customers from all negative ripples of highly-volatile cryptocurrency markets.\n\tThis design underwent four security audits by heavyweight third-party teams, including SlowMist, CertiK, PeckShield and Veridise.\n\tBesides creating all opportunities applicable for the majority of stablecoins, HAY by Helio Protocol can also be used in various \"yield farming\" activities in BSC-based DeFi protocols. First, the staking operations on Helio Protocol are liquid; instead of locking Binance Coins (BNB) and losing access to them, users can get AnkrBNB tokens and use them in a variety of ways.\n\tThen, every Binance Coin (BNB) locked into Helio Protocol‚Äôs mechanisms is automatically converted into AnkrBNB yield-bearing tokens. With AnkrBNB, users can share staking rewards in an automated manner.\n\tBesides that, HAY stablecoin can be used in yield farming initiatives on a number of trusted decentralized exchanges (DEXes). For instance, HAY/BUSD liquidity pool is available on PancakeSwap (CAKE), the largest crypto exchange on the BNB Chain.\n\tLast but not least, Helio Protocol‚Äôs native cryptocurrency HELIO will be distributed between HAY owners once HELIO goes live in the coming months. As a result, in total, HAY owners can get over 7% in APY for using this novel destablecoin.\n\tThanks to its attractive high-performance design and balanced tokenomics, HAY stablecoin by Helio Protocol gained notable traction in its first six months upon release. As of the end of February 2023, the protocol accepted over $60 million in equivalent as collateral.\n\tUsers minted and borrowed over $22 million in HAY equivalent at a 2.87 overcollateralization ratio. In total, 1752 borrowers locked their Binance Coins (BNB) in Helio Protocol, while over $101,000 in equivalent is put into its stabilization pool.\n\tOver $6.65 million in liquidity is locked into HAY/BUSD pool on PancakeSwap (CAKE).\n\tHAY by Helio Protocol is a new-gen overcollateralized stablecoin backed by Binance Coin (BNB). It can be minted by everyone who collateralizes his/her BNB stake. Besides its use in retail payments and DeFi initiatives, HAY unlocks massive yield farming opportunities, built on PancakeSwap and through internal staking rewards mechanisms.\n",

    "content": "\tDogecoin (DOGE) is yet to recover from the tribute Elon Musk paid to Kabosu, the dog that inspired the creation of the meme coin. Since Musk‚Äôs posts relating to DOGE are a major growth booster, the coin has seen a bump in some of its key metrics.\n\t\n\t\n\tAt the time of writing, Dogecoin is changing hands for $0.167, up by 3.67% in the past 24 hours, growth coming at a time when Bitcoin‚Äôs price has entered consolidation mode, however, with a 2.67% surge to $69,218.58. The Dogecoin growth over the past week has not followed a uniform pattern.\n\tIn this time span, the coin has soared 7.72% despite seeing a slip in its trading volume. At the moment, DOGE boasts of a 37.3% slip in trading volume to $2,026,640,330. This traded volume implies a total of 12.4 billion DOGE changing hands in a day. Despite the slight slump in this metric, the positive price reaction shows the hidden hunger in the price.\n\tDogecoin remains highly susceptible to posts from Elon Musk and other influencers to rally. This has been showcased prominently throughout its lifespan as Dogecoin saw a massive uptick when Elon Musk changed the X logo at some point to the DOGE mascot.\n\t\n\t\n\tAmid the sustained legacy of Dogecoin, one crucial expectation is that the proposed X Payments will integrate DOGE payments and provide a unique utility for the coin across the board. While neither Elon Musk nor the platform has officially confirmed this, the affinity the billionaire has for the coin might make him enlist DOGE should crypto payments feature in the everything app he is building.\n\tAmid the growing push in the DOGE ecosystem, the ultimate price expectation is that Dogecoin will return back to the $0.2 price mark in the midterm and $0.7 in the longer term.\n",

Her passing has been felt across the internet, uniting diverse communities in remembrance of the joy she brought to the world.\n\tThe Japanese Shiba Inu inspired a generation of online jokes after her skeptical glance became a symbol of internet humor in 2010. The recent comment by the Cardano founder not only pays tribute to Kabosu's legacy but also highlights the camaraderie that exists within the crypto space.\n\tThe Cardano founder's memetic statement would be essentially true considering the relationship between Dogecoin and Bitcoin.\n\tIn 2013, two software programmers, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, were inspired by the simplicity of Bitcoin to create Dogecoin, a parody cryptocurrency.\n\t\n\t\n\tGiven that DOGE was originally a joke copy of Bitcoin, and used a significant portion of Bitcoin's source code, the two cryptocurrencies share a lot in common.\n\tFor example, both Bitcoin and Dogecoin use a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism involving miners. Transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain are stored in blocks. Once a block is full, a group of devoted users regarded as miners start to validate it.\n\tHowever, several changes have been implemented throughout time, causing Dogecoin and Bitcoin to differ more than they might appear at first.\n",

    "content": "\tNOWPayments, an all-in-one solution for crypto payments processing, is set to introduce Web3 payment methods to a new generation of merchants, creators and charity foundations.\n\tLaunched by a heavy-hitting team of blockchain professionals, NOWPayments platform is an out-of-the-box solution for crypto payments processing. Equipped with crypto-to-fiat paygates and the instruments of multi-currency support, it is set to introduce Web3 tech to thousands of merchants ‚Äî from streamers to e-commerce platforms and charity foundations.\n\tWhat is special about NOWPayments‚Äô USP, and what makes it relevant in 2022?\n\tWhile using NOWPayments, crypto enthusiasts can also earn by joining its multi-level affiliate program.\n\tMainly, businesses are starting to accept crypto for three reasons. First, it allows them to increase operational turnover: with such an impressive new instrument for payments, users are motivated to buy goods or services immediately. Paying by crypto is increasingly popular among the most influential and economically active category of Internet users.\n\tThen, by accepting crypto, a business, creator or NGO can streamline its accounting procedures: in some jurisdictions, cryptocurrency operations are eligible to clear tax regulations (typically, with low tax rates) while, in the majority of countries, crypto payments are still not taxed.\n\tAdding cryptocurrency payments allows businesses to expand their offerings to new regions and significantly advance its visibility in new markets - even for ‚Äòunbanked‚Äô territories with poorly developed financial infrastructure.\n\tLast but not least, as the worldwide crypto community is growing day by day, the decision to start accepting cryptocurrencies is set to increase the visibility of this or that brand between various categories of users.\n\tMeanwhile, the adoption of retail cryptocurrency payments comes with its own roadblocks. The first generation of crypto-to-fiat paygates are not user friendly; to integrate them, a team needs sophisticated software and blockchain engineers.\n\tAlso, sometimes, the procedure of crypto-to-fiat conversion is rather complicated: even if the team manages to set up the crypto paygate, transferring cryptocurrencies to bank accounts might be cumbersome.\n\tThree groups of cryptocurrencies are dominant in the retail payments segment. The first group includes mainstream stablecoins, i.e., digital assets pegged to the U.S. Dollar or Euro. Typically, the U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are the most popular stablecoins for payments while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and SHIB-like cryptocurrencies also gained traction in 2021-2022.\n\tThen, crypto behemoths of the likes of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are also accepted by the vast majority of vendors, creators and businesses. Also, some services work with privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), Bytecoin (BCN) and ZCash (ZEC).\n\tThis is why NOWPayments, an easy-to-integrate multi-platform noncustodial instrument for accepting payments in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, is set to change the game in cryptocurrency retail payments for institutions, businesses, creators and nonprofits.\n\tNOWPayments is a high-performance add-on that allows websites to accept cryptocurrencies. Its mechanism works with unmatched speed: a transfer takes 10 seconds maximum, while merchants get their funds in 5 minutes.\n\tNOWPayments service works in a noncustodial manner; the service does not control users‚Äô funds, private keys or sensitive information. The platform works with automated crypto-to-fiat conversion for all digital currencies provided by ChangeNOW, as NOWPayments is an integral part of the multi-product NOW ecosystem.\n\tNOWPayments has no obligatory KYC though it implements AML procedures in place to secure merchants' and customers‚Äô funds.\n\tNOWPayments provides its users with a wide range of customized solutions, including casino payments, mass payouts and Twitch donation instruments.\n\tNOWPayments allows its clients to start accepting all types of cryptocurrencies from various segments:\n\tIn total, NOWPayments works with 150+ coins and tokens, and new assets are added every week.\n\tAlso, the service is seamlessly integrated with all mainstream platforms for e-commerce, including the likes of WooCommerce, OpenCart, Magento, Shopify, ZenCart, Shopware and PrestaShop.\n\tUnder the hood, NOWPayments service has a feature-rich toolkit of instruments crucial for crypto-friendly businesses, creators and NGOs. First, it has preset API tools for casinos, mass payouts and ‚Äúregular‚Äù services. These three variants of APIs cover the vast majority of use cases for crypto-to-fiat paygates.\n\tNOWPayments can seamlessly create invoices for its users‚Äô transfers. Invoices can be generated via API or a user‚Äôs personal account. In ‚ÄúSubscriptions‚Äù mode, users can set up recurring payouts with predetermined details.\n\tWith the Crypto PoS Terminal option, visitors can pay for goods and services with their smartphone or directly from a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\tNOWPayments supports recurring payments. This option is of paramount importance for all digital services with a subscription model.\n\tAlso, NOWPayments released an easy-to-use donations module. With its mechanisms, NOWPayments customers can accept donations through a widget, buttons, social media links or with custom-made solutions that are available on request.\n\tLast but not least, NOWPayments has a ‚Äúmass payouts‚Äù module. With these instruments, businesses can pay their contractors, freelancers and affiliates. Also, mass payout modules are suitable for salaries and digital loyalty programs.\n\tTo allow crypto enthusiasts to benefit from their social media exposure, NOWPayments launched a multi-level affiliate program. Cryptocurrency users can join this program even without having active online stores.\n\tTo get an affiliate link, a user should set up an account in NOWPayments and visit the Affiliate Program section. Once new clients join the NOWPayments ecosystem with an affiliate link, its owner gets 0.1% minimum as a reward. The program is valid for five years from the registration of the client.\n\tNOWPayments offers its clients the most amazing commissions on the market: minimum fees start at 0.4%; accurate rate depends on this or that merchant‚Äôs turnover. Also, for the majority of assets, NOWPayments has no processing limits.\n\tTo sum up, NOWPayments is a cutting-edge instrument designed to allow businesses, streamers and NGOs to start accepting cryptocurrencies as payment methods, use crypto for donations and mass payouts. It can be integrated with zero extra payments and without specific technical expertise.\n\tNOWPayments created preset modules for casinos, charity and streamers, while its instruments can be available as widgets, buttons, social media links and so on.

    "content": "\tThe popular cryptocurrency XRP, which rose 7% in May, could face potential turbulence in June. Last month, XRP ascended above the important psychological mark of $0.5 and maintained stability, much to the annoyance of investors expecting more significant price changes.\n\tDespite the performance in May, which is in line with the token's historical average gain of 27.7%, June may not bring the same positive returns.\n\t\n\t\n\tHistorically, the first month of summer has not been favorable for XRP. Over more than a decade of history, the average return for June is -5.59% and the median return is -8.92%. This suggests a likely downturn for XRP in the coming month. According to CryptoRank, the last profitable June for XRP was in 2017, and all subsequent Junes have ended with losses of at least 8.15%.\n\tWhile the crypto market is known for its unpredictability, the historical data for XRP represents a significant sample given its status as one of the oldest tokens on the market. Investors should be cautious as patterns over the years indicate a high probability of negative returns in June.\n\tThe stability that XRP showed in May, despite the lack of strong swings, is now in stark contrast to the less optimistic outlook for June. If historical trends continue, XRP bulls may find themselves disappointed as the token could face a decline.\n\t\n\t\n\tWhile the market awaits the results, the reliability of the XRP price history remains in question. Whether historical patterns will continue in June remains to be seen, but the data suggests that investors hoping for growth in the first month of summer should be cautious.\n",

The fraud loss claim against Barry Silvert's crypto giant was then tripled in February in an amended complaint.\n\tAs part of the settlement, Genesis has been prohibited from operating in New York.\n\tIn 2018, James was elected as the state's attorney general with overwhelming support, breaking gender and racial barriers.\n\tSince her historic election, James has cracked down on various cryptocurrency companies.\n\tIn April 2019, New York's top law enforcement official kicked off a long-running legal battle with stablecoin issuer Tether and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In February 2021, it eventually reached an agreement with James with a $18.5 million fine.\n\tSince then, the NYAG has also taken action against such cryptocurrency firms as Coinseed.\n\tIn December 2023, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin agreed to shell out a total of $22 million.\n\tWith growing regulatory scrutiny, cryptocurrency firms have also intensified their lobbying efforts.

    "time": "2024-05-26",
    "author": "Arman Shirinyan",
    "content": "\tDogecoin has regained some major amount of power and successfully moved toward the $0.17 price level, now showing the strongest performance across the market, even beating Ethereum and Shiba Inu. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE's impressive rally has caught the attention of many investors, making it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\tSome of the reasons for the recent surge of Dogecoin are new retail interest and buying volumes. This resultantly increases the buying activity on the asset, hence creating high volatility in the price of DOGE.\n\tDogecoin has now first broken above the 50 EMA, indicating a bullish trend. The relative strength indicator also points to the current wave on the bull side, therefore further gains being expected in the short term. In addition, the increased volume has reflected high buying pressure.\n\t\n\t\n\tOn the other hand, Ethereum and Shiba Inu have not done nearly as well. Ethereum has been pretty stable in gaining a bit, while Shiba Inu has been struggling with an attempt to break out of its current price range. It was all the more interesting with the fact that Dogecoin continued outperforming even these two big digital coins.\n\tAnother fueling factor for the surge in Dogecoin is positivity in the entire crypto market. With Bitcoin and other major cryptos showing signs of recovery, investors seem to be more ready to take risks on alternative coins like DOGE, and this restored confidence has really hyped its price.\n\tThere will be room to stretch closer to the key resistance levels if the current momentum persists and bulls stay on Dogecoin's side. One way or another, any kind of meme coin is volatile, not excluding Dogecoin. Stay cautious and try avoiding overleveraging and poor risk management.\n",

    "content": "\tOpenLeverage, a decentralized protocol designed to allow crypto traders to open leveraged shorts and longs on various markets, shares the details of its tokenomic design and its technical development.\n\tSince its first mainnet launch on Ethereum (ETH) in Q4, 2021, OpenLeverage platform advances decentralized lending and margin trading in multi-chain systems. To ensure the stability of its economic design, the protocol issued OLE, a core native cryptocurrency.\n\tSo, what is special about OpenLeverage protocol and its OLE token?\n\tThat said, OpenLeverage is set to unlock new opportunities for DeFi enthusiasts with various levels of expertise in crypto and blockchain.\n\tMargin trading should be considered a practice of using borrowed money when trading stocks, indexes or cryptocurrencies. In margin trading, traders can borrow money from their brokers, use it to purchase this or that asset and repay the loan later (normally, with a small commission).\n\tMargin trading becomes increasingly popular in crypto markets: it allows traders to ‚Äúenlarge‚Äù their deposit in a number of clicks. Operating bug deposits makes trading more interesting and profitable.\n\tAt the same time, bigger risks come with bigger deposits: margin trading cannot be recommended to crypto newbies. Also, interfaces of margin trading dashboards have far more sophisticated UX/UI compared to spot ones.\n\tMulti-chain cryptocurrency systems are designed to allow crypto traders and liquidity providers to leverage their liquidity stored on various blockchains without leaving a single technical ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù (exchange, DeFi protocol, wallet and so on).\n\tUsing multi-chain systems makes the DeFi experience more streamlined: it removes the need to transfer liquidity from one blockchain to another through cross-chain bridges or centralized intermediaries.\n\tAlso, in DeFi protocols, using multi-chain systems allows traders to access deeper liquidity as they aggregate orders from a wide range of protocols.\n\tOpenLeverage protocol launched in 2021 to introduce the best margin trading practices to noncustodial crypto markets. Furthermore, it unified the largest EVM-compatible blockchains - Ethereum, BNB Chain and KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) - into a seamless ecosystem and supercharged the system with native coin OLE.\n\tOpenLeverage is a multi-chain permissionless lending and margin trading protocol. By Q3, 2022, it has been deployed to Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain (BNB), and KuCoin Community Chain (KCC), while more EVM-based chains are in focus starting with Polygon (MATIC). This allows crypto holders to launch leverage trading pairs on various markets, accessing liquidity from a number of DeFis.\n\tIn terms of crypto businesses, OpenLeverage instruments are useful for emerging crypto products: they can launch margin trading on their tokens immediately upon launch. Also, it allows traders and projects to access liquidity from multiple leading DeFi protocols: for instance, when OpenLeverage was deployed on BNB Chain, its core protocols, such as PancakeSwap, MDEX and BabySwap, became accessible to OpenLeverage clients.\n\tOpenLeverage addresses major bottlenecks of margin crypto trading and the DeFi segment as a whole:\n\tTo make the trading/lending experience on OpenLeverage more comfortable and profitable and to introduce its opportunities to a wide crypto audience, the OpenLeverage team launched OLE, a core native cryptocurrency token. It will also be used in on-chain governance mechanisms.\n\tThe token‚Äôs aggregate supply is capped at 1 billion; this number cannot be voluntarily increased by either the team or the community. This supply is set to be distributed as following:\n\tThe protocol has a solid investment background. In July 2021, it raised $1.8 million during a seed round. Signum Capital and LD Capital co-led the round, while FBG Capital, Continue Capital and YBB Foundation also backed the start-up in its fundraising efforts.\n\tMost recently, in July 2022, it secured funding from Binance Labs in its Incubation Program Season 4.\n\tIn the last year, OpenLeverage amassed over $13.2 million in TVL and processed $691.6 million in trading volume. Its closest competitor Beta Finance has a TVL of $10.2 million; based on TVL‚Äôs comparison, OpenLeverage capitalization has room for growth.\n\tCompared to other majors of the segment (dYdX, Perpetual and ApolloX), OpenLeverage protocol and its token OLE also look undervalued. As per the estimations of its team, OpenLeverage can reach $4.5-5 million in yearly revenue whilst its closest competitors (Perpetual) registered $7 million in yearly revenue.\n\tIn its progress, OpenLeverage implemented various eccentric technical features that make it outstanding among competitors‚Äô designs. It also addresses the needs of various categories of DeFi market participants.\n\tFor lenders, it guarantees periodic rewards on their locked cryptocurrency riches without the necessity to move them out of the initial blockchain. Otherwise, borrowers and traders can experiment with emerging tokens accessing unmatched liquidity pools.\n\tIn terms of B2B operations, OpenLeverage is a reliable partner for project owners interested in boosting the audience of their tokens, DEXes that are seeking a liquidity supply (and seeking to onboard new clients) and liquidity farmers focused on low-risk earning opportunities.\n\tOpenLeverage is a noncustodial DeFi protocol for lending and margin trading. Its multi-chain mechanisms are deployed to major EVM-compatible blockchains Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain (BSC) and KuCoin Community Chain (KCC).\n\tOpenLeverage is designed to allow crypto holders to trade with leverage in a noncustodial manner. It indexes major DEXes on all supported chains and allows traders to launch their own trading pairs and liquidity pools. In all, over 300 markets are available for its clients as of Q3, 2022.\n\tOpenLeverage issued its own core native asset OLE; 7.35% of its supply is distributed between early users of OpenLeverage.\n",

    "time": "2023-12-25",
    "author": "Vladislav Sopov",
    "content": "\tNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one of the emerging technologies that took 2020 and 2021 by storm. Over those two years, the NFT market rose to over $11 billion, with February 2022 seeing over 400,000 users per week across sites like OpenSea and Mints. As the industry continued to build excitement around it, prices and user interest skyrocketed.\n\tDuring the crypto winter, following several major crashes and industry-shifting events, the NFT market began to suddenly drop. However, while there was a major market value decrease, the NFT market is still alive and well in 2023. While many still see the meme sale events as the principle of what the NFT market has achieved, those in this industry know this to be far from the truth.\n\tFrom Play2Earn games to online digital asset trading and the entire GameFI industry, NFTs have embedded themselves all across the world of Web 3 and blockchain. Especially in 2023, where many of the less-active NFT creators have faded away, there has never been a better time to launch NFT collections.\n\tIn this article, we‚Äôll turn back to this emerging market, tracing the three best ways to promote NFTs in 2023. We‚Äôll cover:\n\tLet‚Äôs dive right in.\n\tPress releases are one of the most effective ways of communicating updates about a company, a brand, or a non-profit. Yet, this media format is far from exclusive to those areas, with NFTs also making a perfect candidate for distributing information via news networks. Whenever an artist makes a new collection or wants to share the success of their current works, a press release can be an enormously powerful tool.\n\tEspecially when working with an NFT press release distribution service that already has access to well-established networks of news services, it becomes easier than ever to promote your NFTs. By engaging with these networks, you can distribute content across high-profile sites in the blockchain community, putting information about your NFT collection right in front of the exact people who will be most interested in them.\n\tAs NFT news isn‚Äôt nearly as popular as it once was, the ability to reach the front page of these sites will stir up excitement around your project and ensure that people take notice. Teams can submit crypto press release for NFT projects.\n\tConsidering the high concentration of investors on crypto and blockchain-related news websites, placing information about new NFT projects here is one of the most effective ways of promoting new collections.\n\tSocial media is a central playing field that drives connection. Especially in the world of NFTs, where 1:1 sales drive the industry, forming impactful connections over social media can be one of the most effective ways of generating interest in your NFT projects. Social media allows you to post previews of your NFT projects and snapshots of your progress, drawing attention to you and helping you find potential buyers.\n\tThere are several different social media sites that you can use to promote your NFTs:\n\tAcross the board, these sites will help you find an audience that loves your work and wants to see you thrive.\n\tThe art space, in general, not even specifically linked to the NFT market, is one that thrives on influencer marketing. Especially on sites like Instagram, which provides a visual platform where users can scroll through artwork and find something they love, NFT displays can do extremely well.\n\tBeyond just cultivating your own audience on social media, you‚Äôre also able to generate interest in your NFT project by working with influencers that already have a large audience. The influencer marketing industry is now worth well over $21.1 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing forms of advertising in the world.\n\tBy working with influencers, you can put your NFT projects right in front of interested parties. Yet, unlike with other methods like press releases or your social media, the people who then see your sponsored content will already have a strong positive connection with that influencer. If an influencer shows your artwork to their audience, they‚Äôll be able to strike up an instant connection to your work.\n\tThe NFT market ‚Äì while also driven by money and investing ‚Äì is one that primarily comes back to an appreciation for art and the work that artists can create. By leaning into this factor, you‚Äôll be able to find new groups of people to appreciate what you create. You‚Äôll be able to then siphon new investors from influencer accounts, growing your audience as interest in your projects also increases.\n\tThe NFT market is on the point of surging upwards. Considering its past heights, now is the perfect time to refocus on building a range of exciting NFT projects and launching them to the Web 3 community. However, marketing in the world of NFTs is much easier said than done.\n\tBy following the strategies outlined in this article, you‚Äôll be able to promote your NFT projects to a larger audience, rapidly commanding a following and growing interest in your next launch. You‚Äôll be a thriving NFT artist in no time.\n",

    "content": "\tThe Shiba Inu ecosystem has witnessed a notable rise in activity on its Shibarium network, marked by an increase in a key blockchain metric over the last 24 hours. Shibariumscan reports that transaction volume jumped from 5,150 to 7,930, reflecting a notable 60% growth.\n\tThis spike in transaction volume has concurrently led to a sharp increase in network fees. The amount of BONE tokens used to pay these fees climbed from 16.68 BONE to 32 BONE during the same period.\n\t\n\t\n\tAs per Shibarium's transaction model, BONE are used for transaction fees, and a portion of these tokens is converted into SHIB, which are then burned. This burning process decreases the circulating supply of Shiba Inu tokens, potentially boosting their price over time.\n\tSeveral elements are driving this surge in network activity. Recent market volatility has heightened investor interest in Shiba Inu tokens, leading to an increase in transaction demand on Shibarium.\n\tThis heightened activity is evidenced by a 13.7% increase in active accounts on the network, rising from 687 to 781. Notably, while active user numbers grew, new account creation slightly declined, suggesting that the existing user base is fueling this surge in activity.\n\t\n\t\n\tIt seems that the dual advantages of rising transaction volumes and the systematic reduction of SHIB tokens through burning are driving the network's growth and potential for future value appreciation. This dynamic is likely encouraging SHIB enthusiasts to remain engaged and continue investing in the Shiba Inu network.\n",

    "content": "\tDespite a painful dropdown in crypto market capitalization, Web3 heavyweight KuCoin expands its reach on new markets, implements novel opportunities for its clients, and announces massive community events with a seven-digit prize pool.\n\tIn 2022, KuCoin almost doubled its user number; 659% of the year-to-year user count increase was registered in Asia.\n\tKuCoin, a top five cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem with Spot trading, Margin trading, P2P fiat trading, Futures trading, staking, lending, native NFT marketplace Windvane and Spotlight launchpad, shares the details of its crucial adoption accomplishment.\n\tAn amazing array of community events is set to reaffirm KuCoin‚Äôs focus on community building, global adoption of crypto and bringing a new generation of enthusiasts to crypto markets.\n\tLaunched in 2017, KuCoin is a multi-product cryptocurrency ecosystem with its operational headquarter in Seychelles. For its unmatched newbie-friendliness, feature-rich trading toolkit and polished UX/UI, KuCoin is called the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs exchange.‚Äù\n\tCurrently, it supports 700 digital assets (cryptocurrencies) in spot and futures trading dashboards. Besides that, KuCoin offers spot trading, margin trading, futures trading, P2P fiat trading, staking, lending and mining services for users in over 200 countries globally. It was named one of the Best Crypto Exchanges in 2021 by Forbes, while The Ascent named it the Best Crypto App for enthusiasts in 2022. In 2022, KuCoin raised about $150 million in its pre-Series B round; this fundraising pushed its valuation over $10 billion. Previously, it raised $20 billion in a Series A round.\n\tAs the essential infrastructure for KuCoin to explore Web 3.0, KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) is built by KuCoin community and KCS fans and it‚Äôs a decentralized public chain with EVM compatibility and high performance. Its tokenomics is underpinned by KuCoin Crystals, KCS, a core native asset. KCC onboards various dApps, including DeFis, on-chain games and NFT marketplaces.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn recent months, KuCoin launched its own NFT marketplace, Windvane, to expand its presence in Web 3.0. On Windvane, a number of genesis NFT and third-party NFT collections have already been released for digital art enthusiasts.\n\tAs already mentioned above, KuCoin accomplished yet another user count milestone in July 2022. However, it is not the only achievement the ecosystem registered this year.\n\tLeading cryptocurrency ecosystem KuCoin announces that its registered user number surpassed 20,000,000. This means that H1, 2022, brought a record-breaking number of users to the platform; over 9.75 million crypto owners have opened accounts on KuCoin since December 2021. As such, the last two quarters almost doubled the user count of KuCoin.\n\tOut of this massive upsurge, 5.6 million users come from the Asia region; KuCoin‚Äôs reach in Asia increased by 659%. During the same period, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East ,Europe showed surges of 216%, 152% and 142%.\n\tJohnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, highlighted that despite the crypto market recession, KuCoin is expanding to new markets at an increased pace:\n\tAs KuCoin's 5th anniversary is approaching, the number of registered users surpassed 20 million, which is another milestone for us. KuCoin is growing at a high speed with the support and trust of every user regardless of market conditions. To express our gratitude to users, we will provide more innovative products and services around NFT, GameFi, and Web 3.0 to help users access the crypto world more easily.\n\tThe main reasons for such user numbers growth are KuCoin‚Äôs globalization strategy and focus on new market penetration via better community and language support for new products and feature launches.\n\tTo celebrate this amazing milestone and to introduce its instruments to new clients, KuCoin launched an unmatched trading tournament with a seven-digit prize pool and welcome bonuses for newcomers, the First KuCoin Futures Global Team Battle: a large tournament for traders from all over the world.\n\tThe event itself will take place between July 14 and July 31, 2022. To apply to register, a KuCoin user should visit KuCoin‚Äôs page, join any existing team and create his or her own. Once registration is completed, KuCoin users should trade futures to generate maximum trading volume. The more trading volume the team generates, the greater the prize it will win.\n\tWinners can compete for the top spot and earn up to 20,000 USDT; the team leader receives 20% of the team‚Äôs net prize.\n\tTo get the maximum bonus, traders can invite friends to generate even more trading volume; invitation bonuses are also on the menu.\n\tThe top 10 users by invitation count will also receive a multiplier card; every reward their team gets will be doubled with this instrument. Activists who invite their friends will enjoy an exclusive 40% commissions on team member trading fees ; their invitees will be rewarded with 500 USDT fee-deduction coupons. $100,000 in team promotion subsidies will be provided to support team leaders in producing video introductions, blogs, and AMAs about KuCoin Futures to form teams.\n\tBesides that, Futures newcomers will be able to claim an exclusive airdrop bonus worth 5-100 USDT; both real-time airdrop and retro-drop events will be organized. Extra rewards will be distributed among participants of community events announced on Instagram, Twitter and the main community website.\n\tFor all newbies taking their first baby steps in crypto, KuCoin exchange launched a ‚ÄúLearn-and-Earn‚Äù campaign with up to 200 USDT/person bonuses. Newbie traders will be rewarded for passing tests and quizzes, as well as for transferring crypto, completing tasks and accumulating points.\n\tKuCoin, a leading multi-product cryptocurrency ecosystem, has smashed through the 20-million-registrations milestone. Thus, it has doubled its user count in the last seven months. Largely, this upsurge should be attributed to expansion into Asia and Latin America. Also, the platform launched several language versions and added new instruments.\n\tTo celebrate this accomplishment, KuCoin launched the First KuCoin Futures Global Team Battle, an unusual trading competition for pros and newbies. Participating teams are asked to generate maximum trading volume. Traders can increase their chances by inviting friends to join the event.

    "title": "Kalima (KLX) Blockchain Goes Live, Unveils SDK and Starts KLX Listing Campaign: Review",
    "time": "2023-02-09",
    "author": "Vladislav Sopov",
    "content": "\tKalima (KLX), a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain for IoT, invites developers to develop dApps with its smart contracts and SDK‚Äôs and announces the listing of its KLX token on BitMart, a top-10 centralized cryptocurrency exchange.\n\tAs interest in cryptocurrencies is accelerating yet again after the crypto winter, Kalima unveils its ecosystem of blockchain solutions underpinned by core token KLX.\n\tAs such, Kalima (KLX) address the problems of blockchain usage in enterprise and IoT in a totally novel, decentralized, community-driven, modular and flexible manner.\n\tThe Internet of Things, or IoT, is a sphere of tech development that builds systems with objects equipped with sensors to process and exchange data. On IoT networks, the objects can interact with each other via various types of communication protocol which are interconnected to Internet by the use of IoT gateways.\n\tIoT involves a wide range of ‚Äúsmart devices‚Äù designed for personal, commercial and industrial usages. Wireless sensor networks, control systems and automation mechanisms are the fields of IoT usage in human life.\n\tFrom the 2000s to the 2010s, the concept of IoT gained widespread acceptance. IoT systems can be utilized in industry, infrastructure, ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù, agriculture, medical care, company development optimization, and other B2B and B2C applications.\n\tObviously, such sophisticated systems involve processing large volumes of data. That is why the problem of powerful, high-performance and tamper-proof data processing systems is of paramount importance for IoT as a segment.\n\tTo address these goals, IoT protocols integrate blockchains, as only distributed ledgers can process large volumes of information in a censorship-resistant and low-cost manner. On blockchains, monstrous datasets can be processed for a fraction of a cent. Also, no party is powerful enough to carry out a 51% attack of the blockchain in order to alter the data in its blocks; at the very least, such attacks make no economic sense.\n\t\n\t\n\tGerman-based blockchain project IOTA was the first attempt to integrate mainstream blockchains into the systems of IoT devices.\n\tHowever, IOTA pales in contrast to Kalima Blockchain, which outperforms it in a number of critical technical areas. Kalima Blockchain is a multichain network, which means that its users will deploy and govern their own blockchains, known as PrivaChains, as opposed to the system utilized by IOTA. This Blockchain network approach, along with client-side smart contracts , provides Kalima users with newfound independence and modularity. In terms of speed (TPS) and Block Average Time (BAT), Kalima Blockchain again displays its capacity for scalability, since it can handle 1000 TPS per chain on its ecosystem (separating speed performance from network size) and has a BAT of 1 second rather than 1 minute.\n\tLaunched in 2021, Kalima (KLX) blockchain attempts to employ the cutting edge developments of the Web3 sphere in IoT and leverage the disruptive power of blockchain in enterprise-grade systems.\n\tKalima (KLX) is a highly-scalable modular delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchain tailored to data processing in IoT and enterprise dApps. Kalima (KLX) attempts to fuel an interconnected network of IoT devices, including iOS and Android-based smartphones, supercomputers, small IoT gateways, LoRaWAN gateways, industrial networks and so on.\n\tKalima (KLX) solutions are system-agnostic: mobiles, tablets, smart watches and web interfaces can be integrated into a single IoT framework. Besides data processing, Kalima (KLX) can work as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The flexible structure of its smart contracts can onboard various protocols, from DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces to the protocols of data notarization and industrial IoT applications (carbon tracking tools, digital twins and so on).\n\tBuilding a plug-and-play ecosystem for all entrepreneurs, investors and tech enthusiasts interested in developing and promoting enterprise-grade dApps is an endgame goal for the Kalima (KLX) team, its founders and early backers.\n\tWhile Kalima's core token KLX is already up and running, in Q2, 2023, the first batch of validation pools will go live. The Kalima (KLX) blockchain's own mainnet will be activated in early 2024: KLX supply will immediately migrate to a new network.\n\tKalima's main asset, KLX, is a backbone element of the project's tokenomic design. KLX holders can freely transfer them to each other and use them for staking, node maintenance, dApps building on Kalima, paying transaction fees and so on. KLX stakers will be rewarded for their contributions proportionally to the amount of KLX staked.\n\tThe KLX supply is capped at 480 billion tokens. Periodically, the rewards pool will be reduced by 2 every halving, occurring every new 16 billion KLX emitted. In all, up to 80% of all KLX will be released to its circulating supply. The token comes with a balanced tokenomics, with the KLX supply allocated as follows.\n\tPurpose\n\tAllocation, %\n\tKalima (KLX) Team\n\t12.375\n\tAdvisors\n\t5.125\n\tKalima Foundation\n\t22.5\n\tInitial Seed Sale\n\t3.125\n\tPrivate Sale\n\t15.625\n\tReserve\n\t41.25\n\tThe Kalima Foundation will only use 4 billion KLX per year for daily operations and progress initiatives.\n\tTo get periodic rewards in KLX, Kalima enthusiasts can set up a validation pool; a minimum of 120 million KLX staked is required. In validation pools, there are two groups of nodes: Validator Nodes and Master Nodes.\n\tType of Node\n\tKLX Tokens Staked\n\t(both by node operator and associated delegators)\n\tRewards per Block, KLX tokens\n\tMaster Node\n\t40 million\n\t1\n\tValidator Node\n\t4 million\n\t0.1\n\tBlock rewards will be distributed equally between all active Validator Nodes and Master Nodes, on Kalima MainChain and in every PrivaChain.\n\tAlso, all KLX holders are invited to join a special staking initiative, Pre-Bridge Staking. This program will be active until the Kalima (KLX) token migrates from the ERC-20 standard to its own native one. The program went live on Feb. 2, 2023, and will sunset in Q1, 2024.\n\tThe longer tokens are staked, the higher the rewards will be for participants in the Pre-Bridge Staking mechanism. At the same time, all unstaked tokens during the entire duration of the program will return to their holders with zero rewards. Rewards will be distributed between the successful participants of the Pre-Bridge Staking program within 12 months of the launch of the Polygon-Kalima bridge.\n\tKalima's (KLX) engineers are attempting to build a blockchain for all developers interested in IoT breakthroughs. That is why its software development kit (SDK) is versatile and easy to use. To start building Kalima-centric IoT applications, developers only need to create an account and then connect any devices or services, managing their operations remotely with the Kalima (KLX) administration tool.\n\tDevelopers can create and deploy smart contracts in various languages: JavaScript, Java, Python, Csharp, C, Objective-C, Kotlin, Swift, and Lua. Smart contracts run at the edge and can be used on smart devices, tablets, smartphones and other elements of the IoT ecosystem but also on the cloud.\n\tKalima Network includes the MainChain, which will manage KLX addresses, and PrivaChains which will run developer dApps.\n\tTechnically, developers can choose between running their dApps on their own PrivaChain or using a shared PrivaChain, together with their peers and competitors depending on the dApps requirements. PrivaChains can also be interconnected with other blockchains such as Tezos (XTZ) or second-layer scaling platform like Lightning Network (LN) or soon with Polygon (MATIC) to allow payments in XTZ, BTC or ETH or to publish NFTs on popular platforms.\n\tKalima (KLX) developers should only pay ‚Ç¨0.00025 per KB of data processed in KLX. Also, to own a dedicated private PrivaChain, users should stake 8,000,000 KLX per master node, or 2,000,000 KLX per validation node. As such, Kalima (KLX) makes the barrier to entry for new developers lower than ever before: only holding and staking KLX tokens is required to use Kalima's (KLX) distributed computational power.\n\tWith the success of the KLX listing, in 2023 the Kalima team is now working on the deployment of validation pools. To this day, 6 validation pools are up and running on the test net. The Kalima test net already hosts PrivaChains for industrial applications in Europe. The goal is to obtain at least 60 validation pools to ensure the security of the network by 2024.\n\tA security Bounty is running with success from October 2022 on Kalima Blockchain.\n\tTo trigger an inflow of liquidity to the Kalima (KLX) ecosystem, the foundation started its token listing campaign. Starting from Feb. 2, 2023, the KLX token (as an ERC-20 asset) is available on BitMart, a top-10 centralized exchange by trading volume.\n\tBitMart supports hundreds of trading pairs in its spot and derivatives modules. As of February 2023, the platform is ranked seventh by normalized 24-hour trading volume according to the largest independent crypto statistics tracker, CoinGecko. BitMart registers almost seven million visits monthly and processes $1 billion per day in trading volume.\n\tSince Feb. 2, 2023, KLX token is listed against U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. In just a few days, Kalima (KLX) reached over $116 million in fully diluted valuation.\n\tWith KLX being listed on BitMart in a KLX/USDT pair, all Web3 enthusiasts are able to purchase it on a regulated centralized exchange in order to join staking and validation initiatives.\n\tTo sum up, Kalima (KLX) blockchain is a blockchain network that is concerned with breakthroughs in enterprises and IoT, which is one of the most impressive use cases for blockchains and DLTs. Kalima (KLX) launches with balanced tokenomics, a fair and inclusive staking mechanism, and a modular blockchain network architecture.\n\tThe listing of the KLX token on BitMart is set to accelerate interest in Kalima's (KLX) progress among crypto entrepreneurs, investors, and hobby stakers.\n",

    "time": "2024-05-26",
    "author": "Arman Shirinyan",
    "content": "\tThe Bitcoin price has sent some questions about the future of digital gold with a surge at around the $69,000 level, but maybe some answers can be found on the Bitcoin liquidation heat map, with critical levels at $68,300 and $69,800, highlighting their importance for short-term price movements.\n\tFrom this heat map, clearly, liquidity builds around the prices of $68,300 and $69,800. These correspond to areas where strong buying and selling pressure is focused, making them pivotal for Bitcoin's next moves. Of course, at the current price levels of $69,000, these could easily act as really strong support and resistance zones that will drive the path of Bitcoin for days to come.\n\tTechnically, this is a channel in which Bitcoin has traded, with the 50-day moving average used as good support around the $65,000 area. The RSI above 50 indicates that the bulls have a small advantage, but the market does not show overbuying signs. A balanced RSI points to room for Bitcoin to move in either direction.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis is a very important level because the $68,000 area is a huge support. If price action falls right to that price area, that could actually bring in the buying pressure that supports the price from there. There is a lot of sound liquidity at that level, so it would indicate that a lot of traders have their buy orders set in just expectation of a bounce from that area.\n\tThere is an important area of resistance around $69,800. Breaking above it would mean the beginning of an intensive purchasing flow and thus could lead Bitcoin to new highs. The stacking of liquidity at $69,800 signals that most of the sell-side volume is located there, and this is what Bitcoin has to chew through to keep grinding higher.\n\tNonetheless, the general market sentiment around Bitcoin is still positive, considering the surge in institutional interest and rising adoption. In any case, the short-term view will entirely be a function of how Bitcoin behaves against these crucial levels. Either a bounce off the support of $68,000 or a break above $69,800 would set the stage for the next significant move.\n",

    "content": "\tShiba Inu whales are on the verge of waking up as transactional activity on large wallets seems to be surging and reaching almost 2 trillion. However, the lack of momentum in the market suggests that it is too early to celebrate, and those transfers might simply be tied to funds redistribution rather than anything significant for the price.\n\tFresh data has emerged that more transactions are happening within the Shiba Inu network. For the last 24 hours, 147 large transactions have occurred, whose cumulative volume is valued at 1.9 trillion SHIB. The activity bounces off a seven-day low of 82 transactions that took place on May 19, 2024.\n\tA sudden spike in big transactions could mean numerous things. For one, it's a good probability that large holders in the market are just redistributing their assets. This movement of funds might be related to internal wallet reorganizations, with preparations for future market moves, or simple asset redistribution for liquidity purposes.\n\tAll of this fueled the volume of transactions, but the general feeling around SHIB remained pretty neutral. Price showed no actual upward motion and was still close to $0.000024. The relative strength index confirmed a lack of buying power as well by staying above the 50-point neutral level.\n\tStill, the fact that actions from such whales are visible gives no clear indicator that the price also necessarily increases. The dynamics of the market suggest that these large moves might actually amount to no new investment but circulating capital from existing holders. In that regard, the small price effect was affected at best, and SHIB remains within a tight horizontal range.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis would require sustained buying pressure and overall market optimism for SHIB to really experience a bull run. Indicators are showing signs of a bullish breakout, but not just yet. Investors watch support and resistance zones at $0.000022 and $0.000026, respectively, with a keen interest in the level market movement.\n",

    "content": "\tPhoenix is an easy to use liquidity mining platform with weekly payouts in the USDC stablecoin. It offers it‚Äôs users an easy and streamlined way of earning a legitimate passive income in crypto without having to have sophisticated expertise or a trading background.\n\tDeveloped by industry experts, Phoenix unlocks new opportunities for crypto investors, who are looking for passive income. With it‚Äôs predictable payout model, no lock-ups, and its low, medium and high risk-reward yield programs, Phoenix has established itself as the go-to yield platform for investors from all backgrounds, where you can start with a deposit as low as $100.\n\tLaunched in Q1, 2023 by representatives of Hatchworks VC firm and The Spectre Cryptocurrency Exchange, Phoenix merges the benefits of DeFi and CeFi in a single interface for passive yield generation.\n\tIn general, Phoenix builds a one-for-all liquidity providing marketplace designed to offer everyone passive income opportunities with predictable payouts in both the bull and bear phases of the cryptocurrency market cycle. The platform is aimed at lowering the barrier of entry for beginners and addressing risk management in a modern way.\n\tIn the decentralized finance segment - the sphere of noncustodial cryptocurrency protocols - yield farming refers to techniques for generating interest on dormant deposits. Simply put, not unlike classic banks, protocols pay you interest for using your liquidity.\n\tFor the first time ever, yield farming went mainstream in Q3, 2020, when ‚ÄúDeFi Summer‚Äù pushed thousands of traders to Aave Finance (AAVE), Synthetix (SNX), Uniswap (UNI), SushiSwap (SUSHI) and other protocols. Customers of these platforms earned interest on their deposits and benefited from fluctuations in native token prices.\n\tIn the bear market of 2021-2022, the yield farming protocol segment lost part of its audience, but in 2024 it is actively recovering from ‚ÄúCrypto Winter.‚Äù\n\tYield farming is far from being the only way to generate passive income in the cryptocurrencies segment. Besides that, customers can also inject liquidity into centralized lending protocols.\n\tFrom an investor's point of view, such protocols normally operate similarly to decentralized finance protocols: liquidity providers deposit funds, and a centralized platform lends them to clients and rewards LPs with periodic payouts. However, such platforms provide low APYs for the majority of assets as they are only interested in Bitcoin (BTC), the largest altcoins and top-tier stablecoins.\n\tPhoenix, a new-gen yield generation machine, addresses all bottlenecks of the segment: sophisticated UX, low APYs, high volatility and unpredictable rewards. Its solution is of paramount importance for the passive income generation scene in Web3.\n\tPhoenix, a one-stop liquidity platform for yield generation, is designed to allow cryptocurrency owners to benefit from their idle holdings. With Phoenix, everyone can become a marketmaker on top DEXes without having to go use complex user interfaces, exorbitant fees, network congestion and so on.\n\tOn Phoenix, users are invited to deposit liquidity into their preferred risk-reward program(s). Phoenix then generates yield by routing this liquidity into leading decentralized finance protocols on Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX), two dominant smart contract platforms. For their contribution and deposits, investors enjoy weekly payouts in USDC. USDC is the second largest stablecoin (by market capitalization), backed by the company Circle.\n\tPhoenix introduces the segment of market making to retail clients even with low deposits: the ‚Äúentry barrier‚Äù on the platform is only $100 in equivalent. Compared to other competitive platforms, the Phoenix app offers attractive programs with high APYs and no minimum lockup period. With no lockup limitations, investors and traders can make their strategies more agile and flexible.\n\tPhoenix offers both a responsive web interface (for desktop and phone users) and a native desktop applications for both MacOS- and Windows.\n\tAfter setting up their account, users can deposit money. The process of registration is simplified and requires no specific crypto-related skills. Once the account is activated and validated, Phoenix users can top it up with cryptocurrency deposited from their own wallet.\n\tThen, users can choose the particular liquidity mining program (see below), authorize the transaction and transfer money to the liquidity pool. Algorithms by Phoenix automatically start generating yield once liquidity enters the corresponding pool. Users should only wait for payouts in USDC; accurate APY depends on a liquidity mining strategy and a lockup period for the deposit.\n\tAs there is no minimum lockup period, users can withdraw their crypto with rewards to their own wallet at any time.\n\tPer its documentation, Phoenix offers three programs to its customers depending on risk management details and preferable investing strategy. Phoenix introduced ‚ÄúGearing level,‚Äù an indicator of exposure to the prices of top cryptos, for every available program.\n\tDescribing the risk tiers on Phoenix, the team highlights that yields can expand significantly beyond these levels, depending on market volumes and news flow. Also, the platform‚Äôs representatives added that market makers should feel free to add further layers of protection to every liquidity mining portfolio to hedge capital risk using industrial strength shorting solutions.\n\tThe liquidity from Phoenix market makers is then routed toward three pools: AVAX/USDC on TraderJoe, and USDC/ETH on Uniswap and 1Inch, three top-tier DeFis on Ethereum and Avalanche.\n\tPhoenix platform is backed by a heavy-hitting team of seasoned trading, VC and Web3 tech professionals from various regions across the globe.\n\tThe tech development of the platform is helmed by George Violaris, the CTO of Hatchworks VC firm and a passionate innovative software developer and team leader with 15 years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Java, Python, Go, databases and so on.\n\tPhoenix's battle-tested Quantitative Strategy is developed and implemented by Harvard Business School alum Zen Zijlstra, who is also running due diligence and market data insight gathering at Hatchworks.\n\tMicrosoft veteran Oto-Rem S√ºvari is the head of the research and development department at Phoenix, curating further experiments with liquidity.\n\tTo advance the understanding of the product and its role in the market, the team is holding webinars for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. For further consultations, customers are encouraged to reach the Phoenix representatives in Telegram.\n\tIn a nutshell, Phoenix is a user-friendly app for liquidity mining and passive income generation. In three hedged strategies, it routes user deposits into liquidity pools on major decentralized exchanges, making the entire procedure easy for various groups of crypto owners.\n\tPhoenix offers 7-30% in APY for all deposits over $100 in equivalent, with no minimum lockup time. Thus, the platform addresses all major bottlenecks of Web3 liquidity mining in the DeFi era.\n",

    "content": "\tWith a massive new release by top crypto ecosystem Gate.io, cryptocurrency holders are able to merge the benefits of feature-rich trading instruments with the power of self-custody and the ultimate level of decentralization.\n\tIntroduced in November 2023, Gate Web3 Wallet is aimed at setting new industry standards for noncustodial cryptocurrency services with the support of multiple blockchains.\n\tAs a result, new and existing customers of the Gate.io ecosystem are invited to move their experience in crypto beyond centralized exchanges and custodial wallets to enjoy all the benefits of cutting-edge Web3 solutions.\n\tA cryptocurrency wallet, or a crypto wallet, is a digital tool (software) that allows users to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional wallets, it does not hold physical currency but rather keeps digital information, known as private keys, which prove ownership of a digital asset.\n\tThese keys interact with blockchain to enable secure and confidential transactions. Crypto wallets come in various forms, including software-based (online, desktop or mobile) and hardware-based (external devices). They provide the essential functionality of cryptocurrency storage and transfers, while some of them also allow conversion between various cryptocurrencies, purchasing crypto with fiat money, withdrawals to cards and bank accounts, and so on.\n\tThere are a number of classifications of cryptocurrency wallets, but first, each wallet is either custodial or noncustodial. With custodial (or centralized) crypto wallets, a service provider (the wallet's team) is responsible for storing the keys on behalf of the user. As such, in case of a problem, the team is able to restore access to the wallet but, at the same time, such wallets are exposed to censorship, hacks and being suspended. The service team can control the operations this or that user performs.\n\tWith a noncustodial wallet, storage of private keys is the responsibility of the account owner. Should they lose the keys, no one is able to restore them. However, such wallets are more secure, can be activated without KYC and cannot be controlled by their teams. As such, Web3 wallets are treated as the most advanced and truly decentralized way of using cryptocurrency assets.\n\tGate Web3 Wallet, a new-gen fully noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet, streamlines the Web3 experience for newcomers and professionals. Created by a team with a decade-long experience in building tools and infrastructure for decentralized protocols and Web3, it is set to become a major milestone for the crypto wallets segment.\n\tüòé What Makes Gate Web3 Wallet Unique? üõ°Ô∏èUsers take ownership of their assets ‚õìSupports 40+ blockchain networks üîÆOne-click search for 10,000+ #DApps üîÑ Built-in #Swap Cross-chain exchange Try Now‚ö°Ô∏èÔºöhttps://t.co/4gmzJrtYQy pic.twitter.com/v5wXb0qYaW\n\tWith a couple of powerful tech solutions under the hood, it allows users to easily manage digital assets across multiple chains.\n\tReleased by Gate.io, a leading cryptocurrency exchange service, the Gate Web3 Wallet is a noncustodial multi-blockchain wallet that provides customers with secure and powerful tooling to access various Web3 segments.\n\tWorking on the Gate Web3 Wallet, its team was focused on a holistic experience for its users. With nothing but the wallet, users can explore the entire Web3 world. As the wallet is fully noncustodial, Gate.io bears no responsibility for users' funds, so users can sign up without complex KYC verification or unnecessary checks that are major cryptocurrency segment bottlenecks.\n\tIts users can create an unlimited number of accounts to easily navigate through various Web3 apps and services. This, in turn, unlocks new opportunities for portfolio management for all crypto and NFT users from various blockchain communities. Instead of switching between different services, customers can use multiple accounts simultaneously. Each of them will be associated with an independent on-chain address.\n\tThe new wallet is among the first noncustodial services to offer its customers the opportunity to work with a plethora of blockchains based on Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM, which is the dominant decentralized computations instrument in the dApps segment.\n\tGate Web3 Wallet seamlessly (without bridges, synthetic assets, wrapping and so on) supports operations on L1 blockchains Ethereum (ETH), Cronos (CRO), BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), the largest L2 solutions Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), high-performance EVM blockchains of the new generation, including the likes of GateChain EVM (GT), Huobi Ecosystem Chain (HECO) and even OKT Chain (OKTC), which is built on top of Wasm and merges the benefits of the Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystems.\n\tIn total, the wallet works with over 300 tokens and thousands of NFTs. Also, it is seamlessly compatible with multiple platforms and devices, including web interfaces, mobile apps and browser extensions, which means users can access their funds from any device.\n\tAs cryptocurrency hacks are on fire in 2023, Gate Web3 Wallet developers equipped their brainchild with the latest security instruments. First of all, it received a cutting-edge backup mechanism. Users can choose to back up multiple accounts using Gate Web3 Wallet's robust and secure cloud backup function. When users change devices, they can enter the cloud backup password to restore all data in a confidential and secure manner.\n\tAlso, Gate Web3 Wallet app leverages top-grade encryption and passwords to protect app data and access. The powerful combination of cloud backup, multi-factor authentication and other comprehensive security measures is set to protect users from losses and attacks.\n\tThe very nature of its noncustodial design is an additional layer of security: Gate Web3 Wallet does not store assets, seed phrases or private keys on behalf of users. As such, its attack surface is far less accessible for all sorts of malicious actors.\n\tTo make the wallet experience truly holistic for all users, the Gate Web3 Wallet team integrated a number of DeFi and NFT features into its technology stack. First of all, it features a built-in dApps browser. Users can find every dApp they need and leverage Gate Web3 Wallet opportunities within GameFi, DeFi and SocialFi applications on supported blockchains.\n\tThen, Gate Web3 Wallet‚Äôs NFT Store allows its customers to get the most out of the non-fungible token segment without leaving the wallet application.\n\tBesides that, Gate Web3 Wallet provides seamless access to various innovative blockchain-based activities, including passive income and yield farming opportunities, cross-chain swaps and transfers. With Gate Web3 Wallet, even users with only basic crypto background can stay on the cutting edge of Web3 disruption in the global EVM ecosystem.\n\tWith the new wallet, users can take part in regular (‚Äúinitial‚Äù) and retroactive (‚Äúnon-initial‚Äù) cryptocurrency airdrops. Some of the airdrops are exclusive for the customers of Gate Web3 Startup platform. All listed projects are thoroughly checked for legitimacy and credibility; both cryptos and NFTs are listed in Gate Web3 Wallet airdrops‚Äô section.\n\tAs the wallet lists new airdrops regularly, its customers are able to become an early adopter/participant in the latest decentralized Web3 projects.\n\tFor experienced traders, the new wallet offers an intelligent GateRouting algorithm to guarantee optimal prices, slippage, and fees. Traders can swap and bridge assets across multiple blockchains. Perpetual futures DEX and earning modules are also available on Gate Web3 wallet.\n\tNewcomers to crypto can upgrade their understanding of market processes, track upcoming airdrops and perform Web3 tasks to claim lucrative bonuses.\n\tThe newly launched Gate Web3 Wallet by Gate.io is a modern and reliable noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet. It does not control users‚Äô keys or assets and, therefore, removes the need for complex KYC checks.\n\tThe wallet supports all mainstream EVM chains and can be seamlessly integrated into decentralized applications of various types. It is equipped with a native dApp browser and non-fungible token marketplace functionality. Besides that, its security stack features multi-factor authentication tooling and a cloud backup function.\n",

    "time": "2023-08-01",
    "author": "Vladislav Sopov",
    "content": "\tAs the segment of altcoins is recovering from the aftermath of the 2022 Crypto Winter and recent regulators' attacks, more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are seeking opportunities to benefit from DeFi protocols.\n\t\n\t\n\tImage by Onyx\n\tNoncustodial lending/borrowing mechanisms are popular and newbie-friendly protocols designed to allow cryptocurrency holders to generate yield on their assets. Onyx (XCN) addresses the challenges of this segment in a completely new manner.\n\tLaunched in March 2023, Onyx (XCN) DeFi protocol allows cryptocurrency holders to earn yield from lending and borrowing operations on its noncustodial platform:\n\tSimply put, Onyx is an example of a community-governed noncustodial DeFi machine with feature-rich lending and borrowing toolkits.\n\tDecentralized finance, or DeFi, is a type of finance protocol with no centralized governance. Technically, every DeFi protocol is a combination of smart contracts designed for various finance operations, including lending and borrowing, collateralization and cross-asset conversion.\n\tDeFi protocols have been known since 2017, when the first decentralized exchanges went live on Ethereum (ETH). DeFis are running on all blockchains that can support smart contracts, with Ethereum (ETH), BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon (MATIC) among the leaders.\n\tDeFi's popularity exploded in 2020 thanks to its ability to distribute benefits in a fair manner between providers of liquidity. Also, the majority of them have no KYC checks.\n\tIn the majority of DeFi protocols, crypto holders can lend and borrow digital assets. For instance, instead of selling Ethereum (ETH) or Binance Coin (BNB), crypto holders can collateralize them in an on-chain protocol, get U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) or other mainstream stablecoins, and use it for trading. Also, for using their money in operations, the protocols reward their liquidity providers.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn a similar way, cryptocurrency users can lock their Tethers (USDT) to get periodic staking rewards in a predictable manner. The larger the market capitalization of an asset, the lower its annualized percentage yields on DeFi lending protocols. For instance, you can easily stake low-cap novel altcoins with triple-digit APY, while U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and Bitcoin (BTC) holders can only get 2-5% per year on legitimate services.\n\tYield farming is a common name for the practice of providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for periodic rewards. Typically, a user locks his/her crypto token to get payouts in either native token of the protocol or some synthetic token associated with this or that DeFi.\n\tAlso, some DeFi protocols offer payouts in mainstream altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Yield farming's popularity spiked in 2020 during the so-called DeFi Summer.\n\tYield farming went mainstream thanks to its newbie-friendliness: you can just lock some crypto and start generating rewards instantly. Also, some LP reward tokens rallied in price; yield farming became a significant source of income for newcomers to crypto.\n\tNew-gen DeFi lending protocol Onyx combines the best practices of the segment and makes the processes of decentralized finance operations streamlined and resource efficient.\n\tOnyx (XCN) is a multi-function decentralized finance protocol with lending, borrowing, staking, governance and yield farming modules. It allows users to benefit from on-chain trading, providing liquidity to pools, staking native asset Onyxcoin (XCN) and so on.\n\t\n\t\n\tImage by Onyx\n\tOnyx (XCN) is running on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) protocol: it supports mainstream Ethereum-based token standards ERC-20 (fungible assets), ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (non-fungible assets). Users can collateralize various types of cryptocurrency assets with Onyx (XCN):\n\tLending and borrowing modules are the backbone elements of Onyx's (XCN) design. They allow crypto holders to collateralize their assets in a matter of clicks. In order to lend their cryptocurrency, users should just connect Metamask wallets, authorize operations, move Ethereum (ETH) or other coins for lending, and start generating yield on their staked tokens.\n\tStatistics of APY, history of operations and prospects of yield can be tracked in the \"My Account\" menu in real time. There is no time limit for staking: users can withdraw their liquidity at any moment.\n\tIn the \"Stake\" module, users can benefit from locking Onyxcoins (XCN), the native cryptocurrency of Onyx service. In the \"Swap\" module, users can convert cryptocurrency assets between each other in a noncustodial manner.\n\tLast but not least, in the \"Farm\" module, users can benefit from injecting liquidity into the XCN-WETH decentralized pool.\n\tOnyx (XCN) is among the first decentralized lending/borrowing protocols that has been community-governed from its onset. In order to take part in community referendums, users should stake Onyxcoins (XCN), a core native cryptocurrency of the platform.\n\tFor instance, in late July 2023, holders of XCN can stake tokens to vote for OIP-19: Budget allocation for current operations proposal. XCN's maximum supply is capped at 48 billion tokens, including 25 billion locked in treasury and 23 billion released to circulation. The cryptocurrency can be purchased on Onyx's main website or via leading centralized and decentralized exchanges. The token is now available on KuCoin, Coinbase, Uniswap, Kraken, Bitfinex, PancakeSwap, Bittrex, Gate.io and so on.\n\tFor all assets available on the Onyx (XCN) platform, highly competitive APY rates are available. The highest rates can be claimed for staking BAYC, MAYC and WPUNKS, i.e., synthetic assets associated with \"wrapped\" blue-chip NFTs.\n\tAmong stablecoins, the largest APY is offered for Pax Dollar (USDP); the asset can bring its holder over 33% yearly. Mainstream stablecoins can be staked with 6-7% in APY, while Ethereum (ETH) stakers can claim 11.18% in rewards.\n\t\n\t\n\tImage by Onyx\n\tXCN can be locked through a \"Markets\" menu with 19.82% in APY, in the XCN-WETH pool with 53% in APY and in the direct staking module with 37.74% in APY.\n\tFor all operations on Onyx (XCN), the gas refund program is valid; thus, there is no need to wait for Ethereum (ETH) gas to drop while trading, staking, injecting liquidity and so on.\n\tOnyx (XCN) is a multi-product DeFi protocol for on-chain lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency and NFTs. It allows crypto users to collateralize their fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\tVia a user-friendly dashboard, crypto owners can lock their holdings in order to receive periodic payouts proportionally to their contribution.\n",

    "author": "Godfrey Benjamin",
    "content": "\tShibarium, the Shiba Inu-backed Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, is showcasing a mixed growth outlook, however, with the tendency to hit a major milestone soon. Per data from its dedicated explorer Shibariumscan, the L2 protocol is eyeing hitting the 5,000,000 total block production milestone.\n\tSince its inception, Shibarium has maintained a steady growth pace in all key metrics, except for its erratic daily transaction count. Despite powering one of the most vibrant Web3 ecosystems, its average daily transaction count has slumped from at least 1 million in Q4, 2023, to just 5,150 today.\n\t\n\t\n\tDespite this epic slump, block production remains steady. At the time of writing, a total of 4,900,607 blocks have been produced on Shibarium, leaving just 99,393 blocks to hit the 5 million milestone. At its current pace, chances are that it might hit this record before the end of this second quarter.\n\tAnother crucial data insight on Shibarium is the total transactions and wallet address features. While total transactions come in at 417,549,926, the wallet address count is pegged at 1,803,996. This data shows that Shibarium is thriving within its own ecosystem of dApps.\n\tSince its inception in August 2023, Shibarium has charted its growth course in a majorly organic manner. This is about to change as the protocol has welcomed ShibaSwap, its dominant decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\t\n\t\n\tAs an exchange with many unique visitors, the expectation is that in the long run, ShibaSwap can help drive the transaction rebound as well as attract new users into the Shibarium ecosystem.\n\tWith the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recording intense competition, Shibarium is looking at competing following its latest hard fork event on the mainnet. With faster speed, predictable gas cost and transaction throughput, hitting the anticipated milestone appears inevitable.\n",

    "content": "\tNote: This article contains referral links\n\tOnline trading requires some time to be mastered. In addition to this, you need to find a good provider of services and solutions. By introducing this PrimeXBT review, we want to help you discover PrimeXBT crypto futures, copy trading, and other features of this online exchange. Let‚Äôs step into the world of online crypto trading!\n\tRegister on PrimeXBT and get a bonus!\n\tPrimeXBT is a Seychelles-based entity that provides solutions to satisfy online and PrimeXBT crypto futures trading services. The brand was founded in 2018, and, according to its founders, its unique trading systems aim to make online crypto futures secure and safe for wider audiences. Currently, users from over 150 countries all over the world try to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the company.\n\tPrimeXBT also has an office in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Unfortunately, its services aren‚Äôt available all over the world as there are a number of restricted jurisdictions, including the US, Canada, Japan, France, the Russian Federation, and some others.\n\tSince its debut, PrimeXBT managed to win the competition against many both emerging and well-established online crypto exchanges. Now, it‚Äôs considered one of the best in the market. This is because PrimeXBT is a user-friendly platform with great conditions and profitable opportunities for crypto enthusiasts.\n\tHowever, advanced crypto trading conditions aren‚Äôt the only reasons. PrimeXBT is a multi-asset trading platform where you can access some traditional financial markets, including foreign exchange and stock indices.\n\tHere are the instruments you can trade on this platform:\n\tBelow you will find a closer look at crypto futures versus CFDs on traditional assets:\n\tPrimeXBT offers an extensive range of coins, including popular options like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), as well as a variety of altcoins and emerging categories. This wide array of futures trading pairs allows traders to access various crypto markets and capitalize on potential opportunities across the crypto ecosystem.\n\tUnlike traditional futures contracts, PrimeXBT crypto futures do not have a set expiration date, allowing traders to maintain positions for as long as they desire. This flexibility enables traders to implement both short-term and long-term strategies based on market conditions, without the worry of contract expiration. It's worth noting that perpetual swaps on PrimeXBT also come with competitive trading fees, further enhancing the platform's appeal.\n\tA new feature at PrimeX crypto futures is its sliding margin mechanism, which provides traders with adjustable leverage options. This innovative tool allows users to customize their leverage settings according to their risk appetite and trading preferences. With the sliding margin, traders can select leverage ratios ranging from 1x to as high as 200x. This level of control over leverage is particularly valuable in the volatile crypto market, where price fluctuations can present both opportunities and risks.\n\tThe platform also provides a range of advanced order types like stop-loss and take-profit orders, which enable traders to automatically exit positions at predetermined price levels, minimizing potential losses or locking in profits. Additionally, PrimeXBT integrates with TradingView, a renowned charting platform, to provide users with access to a comprehensive suite of technical analysis tools.\n\tWhile PrimeXBT is widely recognized for its strong presence in the crypto futures trading space, the platform goes a step further by providing access to an exciting range of traditional asset contracts for difference (CFDs). This expansion allows traders to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of opportunities in the forex, commodities, and stock indices markets.\n\tPrimeXBT offers a selection of major currency pairs in the forex market, including EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY, among others. In the commodities market, PrimeXBT offers CFDs on various valuable assets. Traders can gain exposure to precious metals like gold and silver, energy resources such as Brent crude oil and natural gas.\n\tFurthermore, PrimeXBT provides access to CFDs on popular stock indices, representing the performance of major stock markets worldwide. Traders can participate in the price movements of indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, FTSE 100, DAX 30, and Nikkei 225, among others.\n\tThe recent addition of base industrial metals to PrimeXBT's traditional asset CFD offerings further enhances the platform's versatility. Base metals, such as aluminum, zinc, lead, and copper, play a vital role in global industrial processes and infrastructure development.\n\tOne more big advantage of PrimeXBT over other crypto exchanges is the PrimeXBT copy trading platform. Copy trading has a number of advantages for both newbies and advanced traders. The first ones can copy profitable deals and trade more than 80 assets, while the second ones can earn a passive income on the commission from their shared strategies. The platform you will use for PrimeXBT copy trading is called Covesting PrimeXBT.\n\tCovesting PrimeXBT is a unique copy trading solution that is available on not as many platforms as some mainstream software programs for social trading. To start copying deals on Covesting PrimeXBT a trader pay a 1% fee and choose whom to follow. Covesting is very convenient in terms of search and navigation. You can sort out traders by assets they trade, and their yields, examine the performances, the term spent on the platform, and more useful criteria.\n\tOne more important thing to mention here is that Covesting PrimeXBT obtains a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission under the 116778 incorporation number. This means security for users of the solution and safe cooperation between PrimeXBT and Covesting.io.\n\tThe safety of online trading platforms is ensured by several important criteria. Firstly, a platform should have proper regulation under real jurisdiction. The second criterion refers to security in online space. In these terms, PrimeXBT can be considered a safe trading platform. It applies such tools as two-factor authentication and SSL encryption ‚Äì these are the features that protect users when they are on the website.\n\tAs for the security of money storage, PrimeXBT can also be considered a top-notch participant. You can store your crypto funds on both hot and cold wallets. A cold wallet is the safest type of cryptocurrency storage that provides access only through seed phrases.\n\tDespite all the benefits of the PrimeXBT copy trading platform, we guess that traders spend most of their time on the regular trading platform. That‚Äôs why to trade efficiently, it‚Äôs necessary for you to understand the key peculiarities of the trading platform and its tools.\n\tIn our PrimeXBT review, we would like to highlight that in terms of functionality, the PrimeXBT trading platform suits both beginners and advanced traders. It‚Äôs a unique software technology that displays plenty of robust tools for analyses and trading.\n\tIn the header of the web platform, you will three main sections. The first one will redirect to your account, the second one is where you can get some information, and the third one is where you access assets and trade them.\n\tOne more notable feature of the PrimeXBT trading platform is its high level of customization. You can add different widgets and instruments, and even change the design of the board in order to make your trading workspace as convenient as possible. The new crypto futures interface has also added an order book for more intel and trading data.\n\tIn widgets, you can find a lot of types of charts, adjust order types, see your trades' peculiarities, add a section with messages, and much more.

    "content": "\tAs the bull run in crypto is gaining steam in early 2024 catalyzed by the Dencun Ethereum (ETH) upgrade and the fourth Bitcoin (BTC) halving, newcomers and pros are looking for ways to protect and grow their capital gains.\n\tYield App, a reliable battle-tested wealth generation application, offers an unrivaled stack of opportunities for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin holders backed by low-risk strategies and attractive APY rates.\n\tLaunched back in Q1, 2021, Yield App is an ecosystem of services for yield generation on cryptocurrency deposits. It works with fiat as well and offers up to 25% APY.\n\tYield App's tokenomical design is underpinned by the native YLD token on Ethereum (ETH), while its technical stack includes Haven1, an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain optimized for DeFi-centric use cases.\n\tDespite the cryptocurrency segment allowing a number of ways to benefit from working with crypto, only few of them can really be associated with passive or ‚Äúsemi-passive‚Äù income.\n\tIn the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, you can benefit from injecting liquidity into the lending pool. Not unlike services of mainstream Web2 banks, borrowers get the yield generated by lenders who pay for the money they obtain from DeFi.\n\tThis scheme looks secure, but heavily depends on the prices of all currencies involved, takes expertise in DeFi and can be slow and resource-ineffective due to high fees.\n\tThis scheme can be compared to ‚Äúquick income‚Äù schemes: ‚ÄúEarly birds‚Äù share the liquidity injected by next generations of participants. Such mechanisms only work when new participants join the process.\n\tWhile these schemes are typically associated with very high APY rates, most of them fail sooner or later. Also, in some jurisdictions, such activity is illicit.\n\tCentralized earning platforms merge the benefits of various classes of yield generating apps. Just like Web2 banks, they do not leverage users' funds in risky schemes. Instead, the assets deposited by customers are used as liquidity in conservative, risk-averse businesses.\n\tThis class of applications work with stable and predictable yield rates. When it comes to crypto, they access the widest range of cryptocurrencies, including both Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. The majority of them rely on centralized storage and organize KYC/AML checks for potential clients. This class of yield apps is the most secure and cost-efficient one. Also, it is the go-to solution for customers with no previous experience in finance, crypto or investments.\n\tStarting from early 2021, Yield App, a cryptocurrency yield generation machine, onboards depositors of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. With Yield App, everyone can ‚Äúpark‚Äù his or her crypto to get up to 25% in APY.\n\tYield App is a one-stop application for earning yield on cryptocurrency deposits. The main product - a yield-generation module - is accompanied by a couple of useful cryptocurrency economics services:\n\tGenerating passive income for investors of various types is the main purpose of Yield App's operations. Simply put, depositors ‚Äúlock‚Äù their cryptocurrency for a predetermined amount of time to grab periodic rewards.\n\tYield App‚Äôs tokenomic design is underpinned by YLD token issued as an ERC-20 asset on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. As of Q1, 2024, YLD token is available for trading on major centralized (KuCoin, Gate.io) and decentralized (Uniswap, QuickSwap) cryptocurrency exchanges. YLD is integrated into various activities on Yield App as its major utility token.\n\tOn Yield App, every investor is able to find a program that is suitable for his/her investment strategy. First of all, it offers three earning programs: Earn+365, Earn+ and Flexible strategies.\n\tYield App program\n\tCryptocurrencies accepted\n\tSpecifications\n\tEarn+365\n\tUSDC, USDT, TUSD, DAI, ETH, BTC\n\tMinimum lock period is set at 365 days, payouts up to 15%\n\tEarn+\n\tUSDC, USDT, TUSD, DAI, ETH, BTC, ATOM, BNB, DOT, NEAR, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK,NEAR\n\tMinimum lock period is set at 30 days, payouts up to 13%\n\tFlexible\n\tUSDC, USDT, TUSD, DAI, ETH, BTC, ATOM, BNB, DOT, NEAR, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK,NEAR\n\tFlexible redemption, payouts up to 11%\n\tAs such, depositors can benefit from both Bitcoin (BTC), altcoins and major centralized (USDT, USDC) and decentralized stablecoins (DAI).\n\tWithin the Yield Pro module, Yield App offers a complex yield enhancement strategy, Dual Currency (or Buy Low) with APY rates over 50%.\n\tBesides the yield generation module, Yield App has created a number of useful services for a seamless cryptocurrency experience. Its Swap module offers newbie-friendly and resource-efficient crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchange services.\n\tThe fiat paygate accepts the largest fiat currencies, the Euro (EUR) and Great Britain Pound (GBP); customers can deposit them via familiar payment methods.\n\tAs previously mentioned, Yield Pro offers an enhanced services kit for sophisticated investors with high deposits and a deep understanding of how cryptocurrency markets work. The product is aimed at investors with varying risk appetites and investment goals looking to build more complex strategies. At the same time, all information about Yield Pro is summarized in explanatory videos so that every customer can research its design.\n\tYield App‚Äôs over-the-counter (OTC) desk allows big depositors to perform exchange operations worth $100K+ in equivalent with 70+ cryptocurrencies. These swaps are fully confidential and are not demonstrated on any exchange.\n\tLast but not least, Yield App released the ‚ÄúRecurring Buy‚Äù module in beta version. With Recurring Buy, everyone can leverage DCA, the oldest and battle-tested strategy for wealth generation on a growing market.\n\tAs a result, Yield App customers can enjoy a holistic ecosystem of cryptocurrency services without leaving the application.\n\tThe process of registration on Yield App remains clear and effortless even for the newcomers to crypto. First, new customers should set up an account and confirm it via email.\n\tOnce the account is registered and activated, newcomers should pass KYC/AML checks and ID verification. Due to the seamless system being employed, all procedures take a minimum amount of time.\n\tAfter completing registration procedures, users can deposit money in crypto or fiat and start earning instantly.\n\tAs a novel part of its tech stack, the Yield App team released Haven1, a high-performance EVM-compatible blockchain tailored to DeFi use cases.\n\tIts built-in verifiable identity at the wallet level facilitates recourse mechanisms and security guardrails that allow Haven1 to unlock previously unattainable decentralized finance use cases.\n\tCurrently, the blockchain is protected by a network of seven validators. To enhance its decentralization and earn extra rewards, YLD holders can stake their tokens in favor of this or that validator. With over 100,000 YLD staked, customers can access additional services and premium rewards.\n\tHaven1 is fully audited and works with high TPS, which makes it a go-to solution for institutions interested in expanding their businesses to the DeFi scene.\n\tYield App is a one-stop application for cryptocurrency yield generation. It generates interest on Bitcoin (BTC), major stablecoins and altcoins in three programs with different minimum lock periods. Users can obtain up to 25% in APY in regular modules and even higher in Yield Pro modules.\n\tPassive investing with Yield App is safer compared to key alternatives: unlike many CeFi and DeFi apps, it prioritizes low-risk, market-neutral strategies of yield generation.\n\tBesides yield generation instruments, Yield App offers its customers an ecosystem of exchange and earning tools: OTC swaps desk, crypto-to-fiat exchange, automated DCA module and so on.\n\tYield App‚Äôs tokenomics backbone is YLD token on Ethereum blockchain.\n",

There are many impostors targeting #SHIBARMY to cause confusion. Please follow the legitimate Twitter account to get the right information.\n\tIn recent times, the crypto world has seen a surge in the number of counterfeit tokens and fraudulent schemes, particularly targeting popular communities like Shiba Inu. The TREAT token, a proposed addition to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has become the latest target for such scams. Impostors have been creating fake versions of TREAT, misleading eager investors and causing widespread confusion.\n\tThe presence of these impostors poses significant risks to the Shiba Inu community. These fraudulent schemes can lead to substantial financial losses for individuals who fall victim to them. Scammers often use sophisticated techniques to create a semblance of legitimacy, making it challenging for even experienced investors to discern real projects from fake ones.\n\t\n\t\n\tAs reported, Lucie earlier dispelled rumors about the launch of the TREAT token, stating that despite reports to the contrary, TREAT has not yet been officially released. Now as impostors proliferate, Lucie has reiterated the same warning that TREAT has not yet been launched, further urging the community to rely only on updates from the official Treat X account.\n\tAs the Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, community members must stay informed and vigilant.\n\tThe reiteration that the TREAT token has not been launched serves as an important reminder to rely on official sources and remain cautious of potential scams. They should also be cautious of sharing personal information or connecting wallets to suspicious websites.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe team's efforts to communicate and educate the SHIB community are vital in ensuring that the launch of TREAT, when it happens, will be a success, free from the shadow of impostors.\n",

The fourth part takes an in-depth look at various wealth management strategies that are specifically tailored for Bitcoin.\n\t\n\t\n\tThere is also a comparable analysis of Bitcoin and altcoins.

Among the contenders, XRP stands out, with speculation arising regarding the potential launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund in the U.S. next year.\n\tHowever, opinions within the XRP community are divided on the matter. A recent poll conducted on a social network revealed that 66.1% of respondents believe there will be an XRP ETF in 2025, while 33.9% disagree.\n\t\n\t\n\tSome members of the community express enthusiasm for the prospect of an XRP ETF, anticipating increased institutional investment and broader adoption of the token. They argue that such a development could positively impact XRP's market dynamics.\n\tWhy would XRP holders want that?\n\tConversely, skeptics, including prominent XRP enthusiast Bill Morgan, question the necessity of an ETF for XRP. They argue that the token's value should be driven by its utility and widespread adoption as a means of payment, rather than reliance on institutional investment.\n\tMorgan's skepticism reflects a broader debate within the XRP community regarding the token's future trajectory. While some believe that an ETF could bolster XRP's position in the market, others argue that it contradicts the token's intended role as a global currency, which should be freely traded.\n\t\n\t\n\tAs discussions continue, it remains uncertain whether an XRP ETF will materialize in 2025. The question remains: Would an ETF truly be beneficial for XRP, or does its value lie in a different trajectory altogether?\n",

    "content": "\tSince its launch in 2018, cryptocurrency exchange Bitget is aimed at becoming a go-to option for copy trading and crypto derivatives enthusiasts. In this review, we will cover some killing features of Bitget and the most impressive milestones it has smashed through.\n\tGlobal cryptocurrency trading platform Bitget unlocks new opportunities for all enthusiasts of copy trading and derivatives trading in crypto.\n\tIts user base exceeds eight million customers in 100 countries globally.\n\tAs such, Bitget is a textbook example of how a new-gen centralized cryptocurrency ecosystem brings the next generation of traders to the Web3 segment. With balanced marketing, a focus on an intuitive user experience and impressive tooling, Bitget is going to challenge old heavyweights in the CEXes scene.\n\tIn general, derivative contracts or derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from some \"underlying\" asset - stock, commodity, digital or fiat currency. Instead of trading assets themselves (i.e., barrels of oil or gold bars), traders can buy and sell Gold (XAU) and oil derivatives. It is much easier and removes the necessity to store and transfer physical assets.\n\tIn cryptocurrencies, it works in the same manner. To trade Bitcoin (BTC) futures (some platforms use a specific ticker XBT for them), you do not need to store Bitcoin (BTC) physically, i.e., to create a crypto wallet, download and save private keys, authorize every transaction with them and so on.\n\tInstead, users can trade crypto derivatives, contracts with the prices pegged to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and other mainstream and exotic cryptocurrencies. It is far more efficient in terms of organization and is the only option for some anti-crypto jurisdictions.\n\tCopy trading is a strategy of a market participant that automatically mimics the activity of this or that experienced trader. In copy trading, a \"follower\" opens and closes positions together with his \"master trader.\"\n\tCopy trading is a good choice for newbies of crypto markets. It can help newcomers to advance their understanding of markets' mechanisms, principles of trading, various aspects of a broker's (exchange's) operations and so on. However, just like all \"passive income\" schemes, scams in copy trading are popping up here and there.\n\tThat is why it is crucial for new traders to choose a reliable platform with transparent reputation management and feedback systems. Copy traders should always be aware of trading history, relevant PnL and the reputation of a pro trader they would like to follow.\n\tIntroduced in May 2018, global crypto platform Bitget is now one of the largest and most popular platforms for copy trading approved by 8 millions of users with various levels of expertise in crypto and blockchain.\n\tFirst and foremost, Bitget is among the best performers of 2022 in terms of crucial trading volume metrics. In 2022, it registered a 300% increase in aggregate transactional volume across all available trading pairs.\n\tFollowing the collapse of the FTX/Alameda ecosystem, Bitget increased its share in the derivatives segment from 3% to 11%, which is the most impressive upsurge in the segment. Also, in December 2022, when the rest of the segment was struggling with a recession, Bitget witnessed an increase in Open Interest (OI), from about $800 million to $3.74 billion.\n\tThanks to these notable accomplishments, the platform appeared in the prestigious rankings of cryptocurrency platforms. Namely, it made it into the top five exchanges by trading volume and OI by CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, two of the largest trackers of crypto data. Also, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) named it a top three crypto exchange in July 2022.\n\tBitget gained traction as one of the pioneers of copy trading in cryptocurrencies. Since the activation of this function, over 80,000 elite traders started sharing their portfolio, while 380,000 \"subscribers\" decided to follow them.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitget\n\tAs of early Q1, 2023, the number of profitable trades made in the copy trading segment eclipsed 47 million. Followers earned over $300 million, while elite traders got $20 million as rewards for sharing their strategies.\n\tTo enhance the copy trading experience, the platform launched Bitget Insights in October 2022. This portal invites all experts to share their opinions on the hottest market events and trends. In the first three months, the platform onboarded 500 authors who shared over 10,000 pieces of content.\n\tBitget merges the benefits of spot and derivatives exchanges as it offers its customers both toolkits. In its spot module, Bitget supports major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the largest USD-pegged stablecoins U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), native utility crypto Bitget Token (BGB), as well as 480+ other cryptocurrencies and over 580 trading pairs.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitget\n\tSince May 2019, Bitget offers USDT-margined futures. They are easier to understand and therefore can become an entry point for newbies. Also, Bitget was the first platform to introduce USDC-margined futures in 2021; USDC issuer Circle was the partner of this release. As of now, 130 trading pairs are available in the USDT- and USDC-margined futures segment.\n\tTo rebuild trust in cryptocurrency and ensure the safety of all customers, Bitget introduced a $300 million protection fund, the second largest among all CEXes. Also, it was among the first crypto majors to unveil a proof-of-reserves mechanism in Q4, 2022. The total reserve ratio is over 230%, according to the data on its POR page.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitget\n\tBitget is laser-focused on introducing cryptocurrencies to no-coiners. That is why it has scored a number of partnerships to enlarge its audience across the globe. Namely, it became a sponsor of Lionel Messi, the legendary Argentine football player. The partnership was inked amid the euphoria around the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Dubai.\n\t\n\tImage by Bitget\n\tAlso, since 2021, Bitget is supporting Juventus, the most famous Italian football club. The exchange is a first-ever sleeve partner of one of the most winning clubs in European football. As covered by U.Today recently, Bitget also scored a partnership with Juventus' women's team.\n\t\n\t\n\tBesides that, Bitget supports PGL, a crypto-friendly organization behind the largest e-sports events.\n\tSpot and derivatives exchange Bitget is a pioneer of copy trading in cryptocurrencies. Being in the game for nearly five years, it has managed to build a solid and passionate community: eight million customers are using its services. Almost half a million traders used its copy trading toolkit.\n\tThe platform created a transparent security fund and proof-of-reserves mechanism. It added USDT- and USDC-margined futures to streamline the derivatives experience for newbies.\n",

This uptick is not far from the record high of 3.7% observed in March, signaling the resurgence of Bitcoin ancient whales.\n\tThe term \"ancient whales\" refers to the earliest adopters of Bitcoin, who mined or purchased the cryptocurrency when it was in its infancy and far less valuable than it is today.\n\t\n\t\n\tAs reported in the week, an early Bitcoin miner from the Satoshi era has moved 2,000 BTC coins mined way back in 2010.\n\tThe reactivation of these ancient Bitcoin wallets is not merely a curiosity but a significant event that could have profound implications for the market. The spending of such old coins is a rarity, and when it happens, it is monitored closely for potential impacts on market dynamics.\n\tOld Bitcoin miners and whales often act as a source of liquidity and distribution, hence the attention such moves get.\n\tThe cryptocurrency community and market analysts are closely monitoring this trend. Some view the reactivation of old addresses as a natural progression as Bitcoin matures as an asset class. Others are more cautious, considering it a sign of potential market cooling or preparation for a major price move.\n\tAt the time of writing, BTC was up 2.86% in the last 24 hours to $69,126, extending its rebound from May 23 lows of $66,259.\n",

    "content": "\tAndrew Howard, CBO at Jan3 company spearheaded by Samson Mow, has sent a critique against Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin for dumping almost $100 million worth of ETH on the market six years ago, when the ETH price reached an all-time high.\n\tSeveral Bitcoiners, including major figure in the community Erik Voorhees, have stood up to Howard to defend Buterin.\n\tIn his tweet, Andrew Howard recalled that Vitalik Buterin had admitted to public selling of 70,000 ETH back in 2018, when the second largest cryptocurrency reached a historic price peak of $1,119.\n\tAt that price, the amount of ETH sold by Buterin comprised a massive $95,550,000. Howard pointed out that Buterin ‚Äúdumped it on ETH holders.‚Äù He compared Buterin to the mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, stating that ‚ÄúSatoshi still hasn't sold one single Bitcoin. Ever.‚Äù\n\tKid creates $400b with investment of $18m and maxis mad that he profited 0.025%\n\tBitcoin maximalist and CEO of the ShapShift crypto exchange stepped in to defend Vitalik Buterin. The Bitcoin entrepreneur reminded Howard that Buterin had created $400 billion value using an investment of $18 million, and now ‚Äúmaxis mad that he profited 0.025%‚Äù of it.\n\tIn the comment thread, the crypto community started an agitated discussion of Howard‚Äôs tweet. Many called Ethereum centralized, accusing Buterin of holding single-handed control over the total ETH supply, and calling Ethereum an unregistered security.\n\tOne X user, however, assumed that it is unknown whether Satoshi Nakamoto indeed kept all his Bitcoin unsold and did not profit on it.\n\t\n\t\n\tEarlier this week, the American Securities and Exchange Commission issued approval for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds on several filings submitted at the start of the year.\n\tAmong the Wall Street companies that filed for Ethereum ETFs were BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale and Ark Invest. Overall, the same companies that got spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in mid-January then filed for launching similar products based on the second biggest crypto, Ethereum.\n\tThis decision came out unexpectedly, since many experts did not believe that the SEC would take so little time to approve these products. However, prior to the announcement, several funds updated their filings by removing ETH staking from them, since recently Coinbase and Kraken were sued by the SEC for launching crypto staking services.\n",

    "content": "\tSince its launch in Q1, 2022, Coinlocally platform has been focused on pushing the barriers of cryptocurrency adoption among newbies and no-coiners. This next-gen crypto exchange service addresses this goal with its intuitive UX/UI and feature-rich toolkit.\n\tIn June 2022, Coinlocally inches closer to its most significant update in months that is poised to unlock new opportunities for traders of all types. Also, in the coming days, crypto enthusiasts will be able to access Coinlocally NFT marketplace to mint, buy and sell their NFTs.\n\tIn early Q3, 2022, Coinlocally platform rolls out its largest update so far. The platform is going to upgrade its web interface and mobile application; the Coinlocally NFT marketplace release is in the cards.\n\tSo, what‚Äôs new in Coinlocally?\n\tOnce this update is activated, Coinlocally is set to become a leader in the segment of newbie-friendly cryptocurrency trading and saving ecosystems.\n\tTo become a part of an ongoing NFT revolution, Coinlocally releases its own platform for digital collectibles‚Äô experiences, Coinlocally‚Äôs NFT Marketplace. It is set to be launched in mainnet in July, 2022.\n\tCoinlocally NFT marketplace will be fully centralized: all its operations will be verified on-chain to ensure fair and inclusive participation from all teams regardless to their missions and budgets.\n\tThe marketplace will be focused on minting, storage and trading NFTs by top-notch digital content creators globally. As such, Coinlocally‚Äôs NFT Marketplace will allow its clients to access premium and exclusive NFT collections by renowned artists. The Marketplace will facilitate the whole cycle of NFT economics: its customers will be able to create and operate their tokens seamlessly without leaving the platform.\n\tThe launch of this marketplace is a huge milestone for Coinlocally, its global community and entire Web3 ecosystem as a whole. To celebrate this massive accomplishment, Coinlocally is going to launch a massive promo campaign for early birds of its NFT marketplace.\n\tDuring July, 2022, all operations on Coinlocally‚Äôs NFT marketplace will be charged with zero fees. This promo campaign is designed to introduce Coinlocally‚Äôs instruments to a wide audience of cryptocurrencies in different regions of the world. Minting and selling NFTs has never been so resource-efficient before.\n\tFrom Q3, 2022, new and existing clients of Coinlocally will be able to advance their trading and staking experience with novel functions added by the team.\n\tFirst and foremost, spot cryptocurrency trading instruments are now activated in both mobile applications for Android- and iOS-based smartphones and laptops. That said, traders will be able to trade their beloved assets on the go and from home, office and so on.\n\tSpot trading on Coinlocally is available through intuitive and feature-rich interfaces. Thus, Coinloally‚Äôs spot trading module looks attractive for both crypto newbies and professional digital assets traders.\n\tThen, the Coinlocally team added a futures trading module to mobile applications. In the Coinlocally Futures section, traders can earn from price fluctuations in either direction with attractive leverage. This opportunity is risky; however, amid increased cryptocurrency market volatility, it allows traders to boost their profits. Also, on bear markets, traders can additionally benefit from trading short positions.\n\tFor cryptocurrency newbies, Coinlocally Futures trading module can be the first experience of trading with leverage. In the Futures section, contracts on Bitcoin (BTC) are available alongside all mainstream altcoins - Ether (ETH), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC), etc. - and U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) stablecoins.\n\tLast but not least, a cryptocurrency savings module is added to both the web interface and the two mobile applications of Coinlocally. Unlike the majority of saving and staking dashboards, Coinlocally‚Äôs dashboard offers seamless and newbie-friendly passive income instruments to cryptocurrency holders.\n\tCoinlocally savings module offers flexible lending programs with high APYs. Coinlocally users can seamlessly transfer their tokens to savings accounts with zero extra commissions. As in the spot and futures trading modules, Coinlocally savings accounts work with Bitcoin (BTC), the most capitalized stablecoin, U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), and a wide range of major altcoins.\n\tTo make the Coinlocally experience more attractive and rewarding, the platform introduces its NFT Marketplace and first native token, Coinlocally Coin (CLYC).\n\tCoinlocally is going to release its pioneering asset, Coinlocally Coin (CLYC), on July 1, 2022. The token is set to be unveiled through the initial coin offering (ICO) campaign, the oldest token sale method in Web3.\n\tIn total, the protocol team will issue 1,000,000,000 CLYC tokens. This supply is final and will not be increased under any circumstances. CLYC token will be issued as a BEP-20 token on BNB Chain, a programmatic blockchain by world-leading crypto exchange Binance (BNB).\n\tTo ensure fair, democratic and inclusive participation, Coinlocally sets one price for all participants of the upcoming ICO. One Binance Coin (BNB) will be equal to 55,000 CLYC tokens; as such, 1 CLYC will be worth about $0.004. CLYC tokens will be available on Coinlocally‚Äôs main website.\n\tCLYC tokens will be integrated into various Coinlocally services. To start with, since Q3, 2022, CLYC tokens will be accepted into the platform‚Äôs staking module alongside a few other tokens.\n\tIn Q1, 2023, CLYC token will be moved to a self-hosted blockchain with smart contracts support. CLYC will also be integrated into Coinlocally trading instruments together with Bitcoin, Ethereum, U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and so on. Since Q2-Q3, 2023, CLYC tokens will be integrated into futures and margin sections of the Coinlocally trading toolkit.\n\tIn Q4, 2023, CLYC tokens will be integrated into Coinlocally‚Äôs decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX). Also, in 2023, CLYC tokens will be added to Coinlocally‚Äôs Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market and one-click Coinlocally Convert instrument. Coinlocally Convert will be the easiest way to buy cryptocurrency suitable for traders with basic expertise in crypto and blockchain.\n\tWith this update, Coinlocally evolves into a go-to ecosystem for cryptocurrency spot and futures trading, saving, exchange and staking.\n\tCoinlocally‚Äôs trading dashboard looks like that of a Tier 1 crypto exchange. It demonstrates real-time price charts, an orderbook, order history and a module for the on-click placement of market and limit orders.\n\tIn a spot trading module, over 100 assets are available, including the likes of crypto heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum, novel DeFi coins AAVE and 1INCH, leading PoS cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC), top-notch USD-pegged stablecoins USDT, USDC, TUSD, GUSD and so on. Also, Coinlocally accepts leading fiat currencies like USD, EUR, TRY, IDRT and GBP.\n\tIn the savings module, crypto holders can lock their assets for a predetermined period to receive periodic payouts on their dormant crypto riches.\n\tTo allow its users to monetize their social media influence, Coinlocally launched a multi-level referral program. For every referral invited, users of Coinlocally can get up to 40% of their aggregated trading commissions. Also, every trader joining Coinlocally through the referral program can also use the platform with double-digit discounts on trading fees.\n\tAlso, for traders with a large audience on social networks (5,000+ followers for social media accounts or 500+ members for the trading community), Coinlocally introduced an attractive and rewarding Affiliate Program. Affiliate Program leaders can get up to 40% from trading fees raised from invited users.\n\tCoinlocally infrastructure can be used for airdrops and trading tournaments. For instance, in Q1, 2022, Coinlocally organized a COTI airdrop for Binance (BNB) users. A total of 114 million COTI tokens were distributed between the participants of this airdrop.\n\tAlso, the Coinlocally community participates in Binance‚Äôs trading tournaments. It onboards traders with 500+ USDT in trading volume in 2022. The best traders get extra rewards from the Coinlocally platform (up to 500 Binance USD [BUSD] stablecoins).\n\tCoinlocally, a multi-product newbie-friendly cryptocurrency ecosystem, undergoes a major upgrade: it includes the launch of spot and futures trading in applications and web interfaces.\n\tAlso, its team inches closer to the ICO of its first native asset, Coinlocally Coin (CLYC). The token sale kicks off on July 1, 2022, on the official website of Coinlocally.\n",

    "content": "\tAs the blockchain segment is recovering from the severe Crypto Winter of 2021-2022, protocols of various spheres are introducing their tools to Web3 newbies. Here's why this is crucial to highlight the fun and profit opportunities available for newcomers with no previous experience in crypto.\n\tEZZY Game, a multi-platform move-to-earn and play-to-earn ecosystem, prioritizes an intuitive user experience to lower the barrier to entry for newcomers in cryptocurrency gaming.\n\tLaunched in November 2022, EZZY Game promotes itself as the most newbie-friendly product across the move-to-earn and play-to-earn scenes.\n\tAs such, EZZY Game introduces an amazing world of modern move-to-earn to all categories of crypto enthusiasts with no regard to their background or deposit sizes.\n\tIn the cryptocurrency sphere, play-to-earn is a class of blockchain-based applications designed to allow crypto holders to earn through interacting with gamified protocols. Simply put, play-to-earn (or P2E) apps are video games that somehow use blockchain technology for rewards or business logic.\n\t\n\t\n\tNamely, play-to-earn apps can accept starting deposits and distribute prizes in cryptocurrency assets. At the same time, they can also use blockchains to transfer in-game objects, to mint the results of tournaments and so on.\n\tThe play-to-earn segment rocketed to prominence in 2021. At this time, Decentraland (MANA), The Sandbox (SAND) and Axie Infinity (AXS) are the most popular play-to-earn applications.\n\tMove-to-earn is a subclass of decentralized applications (dApps) where people can earn rewards for their physical activity. Typically, prizes in cryptocurrency are distributed for jogging, hiking, climbing or doing simple fitness exercises, as these activities can be easily tracked remotely through smartphone apps.\n\tOften, these apps integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as core mechanisms for user identification and maintaining complex gaming mechanics. Tokenized sports footwear (sneakers) became symbols of the move-to-earn segment that rallied in 2021-2022 despite an overall crypto recession.\n\tBesides a fancy design and immersive gameplay, modern move-to-earn apps can be a reliable source of income for crypto enthusiasts. Here's how ordinary players with basic skills in crypto can benefit from using move-to-earn apps.\n\tEZZY Game, a high-performance application for smartphones, invites a new generation of crypto enthusiasts to experiment with virtual sneakers and grab EZY rewards for being physically active or playing games in app.\n\tEZZY Game is an M2E (move-to-earn) and P2E (play-to-earn) game with integrated Web3 elements. It was launched at the bottom of the bearish market in November 2022. EZZY Game is set to provide the easiest move-to-earn experience for all digital token enthusiasts.\n\t\n\tImage by EZZY Game\n\tThe EZZY Game is available for free from both App Store and Google Play, two major digital marketplaces. Immediately upon installation, users can start getting rewards in two ways.\n\tNewcomers can start training by jogging at a speed of two to twenty kilometers per hour. The first rewards are assigned within 10 minutes. Also, EZZY Game players can start with an entirely virtual experience: they can catch coins for 10 minutes and also be rewarded with EZY tokens.\n\tThe EZZY Game team has always stressed that its product is not a clone of Stepn, Step App or other mainstream move-to-earn games. Its gaming mechanics are unique and much easier than those of competitors.\n\tAs we mentioned before, EZZY Game virtual tokenized sneakers are a backbone element of EZZY Game gameplay and the most accessible way to boost one's earning strategy on the platform. The sneakers can be purchased directly in the application in its Factory module.\n\t\n\tImage by EZZY Game\n\tUsers can spend $30 minimum on sneakers. Once they are purchased, users can get a 10% token bonus in 10 days or a 30% bonus on a monthly deposit if it is reinvested.\n\t\n\tImage by EZZY Game\n\tNamely, when a user buys sneakers at the Factory for EZY tokens, walks and/or plays for 10 days, he or she gets the amount invested and 10% on top. After that, the sneakers become inactive and the player needs to buy new ones. The cycle can be repeated an unlimited number of times; the user can buy as many sneakers as he or she wishes.\n\tEZY, a cryptocurrency token on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), the cheapest EVM-compatible blockchain, is the second pillar of EZZY Game's tokenomics. This asset is used to pay out rewards to users and to support community programs in the application.\n\tThe token can be purchased within the application with U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, and on decentralized exchanges PancakeSwap (CAKE) via USDT and BNB, respectively.\n\tThanks to the balanced tokenomics of EZY, its price has fluctuated within the $0.055-0.06 corridor during almost its entire period of public tracking on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\n\tUsers can request their EZY rewards at any time; the tokens can be withdrawn to both centralized (Binance) and on-chain (TrustWallet, MetaMask) wallets.\n\tAs the EZZY Game is focused on bringing millions of users to move-to-earn, it introduced a free-to-join trial campaign with free sneakers. This option is designed to introduce EZZY Game's gameplay to newcomers.\n\t\n\tImage by EZZY Game\n\tTrial sneakers can be claimed immediately upon registration. With trial sneakers, all instruments of the full-fledged version of EZZY Game app are available.\n\tAlso, to spread the word about the application and its opportunities, the EZZY Game team launched a referral program. Users can share their personal promo code to invite followers and friends to the EZZY Game and get free sneakers for it. For every 10 pairs of sneakers purchased by his/her referrals, an owner of a promo code gets one pair as an affiliate reward.\n\tTo sum up, EZZY Game is an amazing play-to-earn and move-to-earn game designed to make the playing experience easier for users with basic skills. It shares EZY rewards when users walk. To join EZZY Game, newcomers need to purchase virtual sneakers within the application.\n\tIn May 2023, the EZZY Game team held a trial sneaker campaign: everyone can get a pair of test items to experiment with all functions of the EZZY Game app. Also, a referral program is available for EZZY Game players.\n",

    "author": "Arman Shirinyan",
    "content": "\tSolana is preparing for its bounce back as the asset hits the gas pedal near the $170 level, possibly changing the trajectory. Hopefully, the price level mentioned in the heading of this post turns out to be prophetic shortly. Recent price action does seem to suggest that Solana might be preparing for a significant breakout as it tests the $180 level in the near future.\n\tNow, turning the light on to technical indicators, there are plenty of buy signals in the price of Solana on the daily chart. The price has held properly on top of the 50-day moving average, which stands as a significant support in an uptrend rally. RSI pointing upward still has room to go until it reaches 70 and currently is above the 50 level, indicating rising buying pressure.\n\tMeanwhile, volume has risen aggressively over the last few days, an indication of growing demand and investor confidence in the future of Solana. The MACD indicator also holds that the bullish signals stay intact as the MACD line travels above the signal line. Of course, the road to $180 will be extremely thorny for Solana, with the first critical resistance lying around $175, where the price has met resistance in the past.\n\t\n\t\n\tIf Solana manages to cross this, then the next target becomes the $180 level. If Solana further manages to break this level, then the bull rally might push even even higher to eye the $200 level. Investors have a positive outlook before the Ethereum ETF. The analysts believe that the next in line for an ETF is Solana. But it should be wiser to wait when the confirmation of the Ethereum ETF is here.\n",

    "time": "2024-05-26",
    "author": "Tomiwabold Olajide",
    "content": "\tThe Cardano network has reached a significant milestone, surpassing 10 million native tokens. This achievement underscores Cardano's increasing adoption within the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\n\tNative tokens allow the transacting of multi-assets on Cardano. Cardano uniquely allows users to transact with ADA, as well as an unlimited number of user-defined (custom) tokens natively.\n\tNative support has specific advantages for developers: There is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which eliminates an additional layer of complexity and the possibility of manual errors because the ledger manages all token-related functionality.\n\tAccording to the most recent IOG weekly report, native tokens have reached 10 million with 120,576 token policies. Currently, network transactions have reached 90.8 million, while Plutus scripts are at 46,698.\n\t\n\t\n\tLooking ahead, the Cardano network is poised for further growth and expansion. The continued development of its smart contract capabilities and the upcoming upgrades such as the Chang network upgrade are expected to attract even more users to the platform.\n\tCardano's ADA recent price rise appears to have stalled under the pressure of its daily moving averages.\n\tADA began to rise gradually and reached highs of $0.51 on May 21 before running into resistance. After that, ADA decreased for four days in a row before rising again. Selling has continued, with ADA down 0.33% to $0.4611 at the time of writing, during the last 24 hours.\n\tThe 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) have posed significant barriers to the rising trend of ADA since the beginning of April. Further conjecture over the short-term price trajectory of ADA is raised by a recent crossing that showed a death cross. The 50-day EMA serves as an immediate resistance level for ADA in the short term, which it must surpass to indicate a possible rally.\n\t\n\t\n\tFollowing the approval of Ethereum ETFs, traders, and analysts will continue to watch the indicators and market signals closely, ready to adjust their strategies in response to ADA's next significant move. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of ADA's price.\n",

    "content": "\tExchangers, i.e., third-party independent indexers of buying/selling crypto options help traders and investors navigate the process of obtaining cryptocurrency.\n\tCryptocurrency has evolved into one of the most dominant finance alternatives in the world, surpassing the popularity of some Web2 fiat digital payments systems. As such, we can see the growing influence of the cryptocurrency segment on global economical processes.\n\tWhile, technically, cryptocurrency can be bought, sold, and transferred in many ways, there is one way that is focused on making the entire procedure more streamlined and resource efficient. Crypto exchangers, or crypto exchange monitors, are gaining traction in the digital assets segment.\n\tCrypto exchangers are newcomer-friendly platforms designed to allow customers to purchase digital assets. Although exchangers have KYC procedures, the majority of them work with no ID verification.\n\tAt the same time, exchanger monitors and aggregators can filter out fraudulent and suspicious services by listing only credible services after stringent due diligence procedures. BestChange is one of the oldest and most reputable services of this type.\n\tIn 2023, struggling with the aftermath of Crypto Winter, i.e. a prolonged market recession of 2021-2022, cryptocurrencies segment set a number of records in trading volume, new crypto users, and so on. As stressed by ChainAnalysis in its The 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index, for the countries with low and middle income, the metrics of grassroots crypto adoption set a new all-time high in 2023.\n\tThis massive upsurge amplified the problems of exchanges credibility: attack resistance, team reputation, and so on. Above mentioned crypto exchanger monitors are among the most mainstream ways to address reputation issues in the cryptocurrency conversion sphere.\n\tSome services of this type launched even in the pre-crypto era. For instance, BestChange exchange monitor kicked off over 16 years ago, on June 19, 2007, by a group of software developers focused on fintech solutions. As such, it is much older than all cryptocurrencies and was initially focused on fiat-to-fiat conversion or foreign currency exchange. It can be taken as an example of this service thanks to large user count and an impressive number of services indexed.\n\tIn terms of tech design, the exchange monitor was first envisioned as a cryptocurrency exchanger itself. However, the team pivoted to more promising and valuable USP, i.e., a service that ranks exchangers to combat scams in this sphere.\n\tThe pivot was inspired by the emerging services for exchange rate comparison, and the idea to create a better version of such a service was quick to follow.\n\tThe English version of the service was deployed to the domain bestchange.com. The name is set to reaffirm the highlight of the BestChange team to indicating and displaying the best ways to buy, sell and transfer various cryptocurrencies. The service went live with an initial investment of just $1,000 and smashed through a breakeven milestone just 12 months after release.\n\tThe popularity of the service skyrocketed in 2016-2017 amid the first massive cryptocurrency euphoria. Currently, the exchange is headquartered in Dubai, UAE, which is the most influential global fintech hub.\n\tFrom the onset of its operations, the project was envisioned with maximum user-friendliness in mind. Users just need to select the initial currency, the type of fiat payment tool and the name of the cryptocurrency this or that customer is looking to buy, e.g., USD/PayPal to Bitcoin (BTC). Icons next to the exchanger show additional information, for instance, whether an exchanger requires verification.\n\tAs of 2023, BestChange indexes operations with all sorts of mainstream cryptocurrencies, including top heavyweights Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), veteran altcoins Nem (NEM), Eos (EOS) and IOTA (MIOTA), the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA) and Tronics (TRX), major DeFi coins Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI), alongside trending meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\tNeedless to say, BestChange also supports operations with all mainstream stablecoins: U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT), USDC and Dai (DAI), the largest decentralized stablecoin. The platform tracks services working with versions of stablecoins launched on the top of Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Tron (TRX).\n\tIn terms of fiat payment methods, BestChange is suitable for users of Visa and Mastercard debit/credit cards, B2B accounts, wire transfers, as well as of major digital cash systems PayPal, Perfect Money, WebMoney, Skrill, Payeer, Qiwi, Payoneer, AdvCash and so on. BestChange tracks popular fiat currencies, including the likes of USD, EUR, TRY, AUD, CAD and GBP.\n\tThe platform takes it upon itself to perform due diligence checks of the exchanger's reliability to prevent suspicious services from being demonstrated on BestChange.\n\tThe service has established itself as one of the leading platforms on the market: it is responsible for an over 80% user base of people interested in crypto exchange monitoring platforms.\n\tBestChange.com remains the leader in its segment, drawing 70% of users of all monitors. During the 2020-2021 bullish rally, BestChange.com managed to surpass numerous crypto-centric portals by popularity: its MAU was over eight million users during periods of peak traffic.\n\tThe service is constantly fighting against scammers and malefactors that try to create its phishing copies. BestChange reports them to the administration of browsers so that they are flagged as fraudulent and prevented from being entered.\n",

Saylor is convinced that Bitcoin is going to account for up to 70% of that allocation as the leader of the crypto asset class.\n\t\"In fact, it might be better for Bitcoin because we are politically much more powerful‚Ä¶supported by the entire cryptocurrency industry‚Ä¶They obviously have a lot of political power, a lot of users, and they serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin,\" he said.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn a stunning U-turn, several 19b-4s listing requests filed by Ethereum ETF issuers were approved earlier this week.

For now, it is unclear when these Ethereum ETFs will actually start trading since the SEC also has to approve corresponding S-1 registration statements.\n\t\n\t\n\tSaylor has now changed his tune after previously predicting that Ethereum would never be accepted by Wall Street since it is very \"clear\" that the flagship altcoin is a security. He claimed that Bitcoin was the only \"institutional grade crypto asset.\"\n",
